<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the train sped through the night Grace Durland
decided that after all it didn&#8217;t matter so much!</p>

<p>She had parted tearfully from the girls at the
sorority house and equally poignant had been the goodbyes
to her friends among the faculty; but now that
it was all over she was surprised and a little mystified
that she had so quickly recovered from her disappointment.
Bitterness had welled in her heart at the
first reading of her mother&#8217;s letter calling her home.
Her brother Roy, always the favored one, was to remain
at the University to finish the law course, for
which he had shown neither aptitude nor zeal, and
this hurt a little. And they might have warned her
of the impending crisis in the family fortunes before
she left home to begin the fall term, only a
month earlier.</p>

<p>But her resentment had passed. The spirit of
adventure beat in her breast with strong insistent
wing. With the fatalism of imaginative youth she
was already assuring herself that some force beyond
her control had caught her up and was bearing her
on irresistibly.</p>

<p>She lay back at ease in her seat in the day
coach, grateful that there were no acquaintances on
the train to interrupt her reveries. She was twenty-one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
tall, slightly above medium height and bore
every mark of sound health and wholesome living&mdash;a
fair representative of the self-reliant American girls
visible on the campus of all Mid-Western colleges.
The excitement of her hasty packing and leave-taking
had left a glow in her olive cheeks. Her hair, where
it showed under her sport hat, was lustrous black;
her eyes were brown, though in shadow they changed
to jade,&mdash;variable, interesting eyes they were, that
arrested attention by their quick play of emotion.
They expressed her alert intelligence, her frank curiosity,
her sympathetic and responsive nature.</p>

<p>When the train reached Indianapolis she left her
trunk check with the transfer agent and boarded a
street-car. At Washington street, she transferred to
the trolley line that ran down New York street, where
the Durland home faced Military Park. New York
street between the old canal and the western end of
the park had once been a fashionable quarter of the
town, and the old houses still stood though their
glory of the Civil War time and the years immediately
succeeding had departed. The Durlands lived in a big
square brick house, set well back in a yard that rose
a little above the street. The native forest trees in
the lots all along the block added to the impression
of age imparted by the houses themselves. Under the
branches of the big walnut in the Durland front yard
the neighborhood children of Grace&#8217;s generation had
gathered to play. The tree was identified with her
earliest recollections; it had symbolized the stability
of the home itself.</p>

<p>She pushed open the iron gate and hurried up the
brick walk. Her ring brought her mother to the
door, clutching a newspaper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, <i>Grace</i>! I had no <i>idea</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>She caught the girl in her arms, then held her away,
looked into her eyes and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, dear! I know what it means to you.
It&#8217;s a terrible disappointment to all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I understand everything, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t expect you so soon. I don&#8217;t see how
you managed it. I thought you&#8217;d probably wait till
Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t have done that, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Roy? He didn&#8217;t write at all last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s flourishing and sent his love to everybody.
He promises to work harder than ever now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he will. I know he was sorry to see you
leave; he&#8217;d know what a wrench it would be for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had been talking in the hall, with Grace&#8217;s
suitcase and tennis racket lying on the floor where
she had dropped them. She pushed them out of the
way at the foot of the old-fashioned stair that rose
steeply just inside the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about your things now, Grace. Your
father&#8217;s in the sitting room and Ethel&#8217;s up in the
spare room sewing. Have you had your supper?
There&#8217;s some cold baked chicken in the ice-box and
I can make you some hot tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had supper before I left, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland lifted her head and called her older
daughter&#8217;s name and from some remote place Ethel
answered. Mrs. Durland was as dark as Grace, but
cast in a larger mold, and while there were points of
resemblance in their faces there was a masculine vigor
in the mother that the girl lacked. Mrs. Durland&#8217;s
iron-gray hair was brushed back smoothly from her
low broad forehead. She wore an authoritative air,
suggesting at once managerial capacity; a woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
one would say, strongly independent in her thinking;
self-assertive and obstinate, but of kind and generous
impulses.</p>

<p>Grace was already in the sitting room, where she
tip-toed up behind her father, who was absorbed in a
book that he read as it lay on the table before him.
His bent shoulders suggested that this was his habitual
manner of managing a book. Grace passed her hands
over his thick shock of disordered hair and patted his
cheek; then bent and laid her face against his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here I am, daddy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not home, Grace!&#8221; he exclaimed looking up at
her bewilderedly. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t tell me you were
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a surprise! Nobody knew I was coming tonight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well; I didn&#8217;t know there was a train at this
hour. It&#8217;s nice to see you, Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the open volume with an absent confused
air, as though uncertain whether anything
further was expected of him, then pushed his chair
back from the table. Mrs. Durland had come in,
followed quickly by Ethel carrying a work-basket
and a blouse that she had been at work on when interrupted
by the announcement of her sister&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>Ethel was twenty-seven, an indefinite blonde, and
not so tall as Grace. Her mother said that she was a
Durland, specifically like one of her husband&#8217;s sisters
in Ohio, a person for whom Mrs. Durland had never
evinced any great liking. Mrs. Durland was a Morley
and the Morleys were a different stock, with the
Kentucky background so precious in the eyes of many
Indianians. Mrs. Durland&#8217;s father had been a
lawyer of small attainments in a southern Indiana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
county, but it was in her grandfather Josiah B. Morley,
who sat in the Constitutional Convention of 1851,
and was later a speaker of the Indiana house of representatives,
that her pride concentrated. She had
married Durland in Rangerton, where as a young
man he had begun with Isaac Cummings the manufacture
of a few mechanical specialties, removing
shortly to Indianapolis with a number of Durland&#8217;s
inventions and Cummings&#8217;s small capital as the
foundation of their fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things have changed some since you left, Grace.
And I&#8217;m sorry you had to quit school,&#8221; Durland was
saying, while Ethel, having greeted her sister, sat
down by the smoldering coal fire and resumed her
sewing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, father,&#8221; said Grace, who had taken
off her hat and coat. &#8220;I came back as soon as I got
the news so you and mother would know it&#8217;s all
right with me. We&#8217;re all going to put up a cheerful
front, no matter what happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ve all got to do that,&#8221; murmured
Ethel without looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard on you children,&#8221; said Durland. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all my fault; I&#8217;ve got nobody to blame but myself,
Grace. Cummings always seemed willing for me to
go on as I did for twenty years, trying to improve
on the old patents and develop new ideas. But ideas
don&#8217;t come as fast as they used to. I guess he
thought he&#8217;d got everything I was ever likely to have
to offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was certainly unkind, after all the years you&#8217;d
been together. But I don&#8217;t believe for a minute your
work&#8217;s done. You&#8217;ll strike something bigger than
any of your old inventions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been telling father,&#8221; said Ethel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
&#8220;A man who&#8217;s spent years inventing things is likely
to find something big any time. Of course, without
the shop father can&#8217;t work as well, but he&#8217;s going to
have a shop of his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s fine, father!&#8221; exclaimed Grace. &#8220;Where
is the new place going to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not much of a place,&#8221; Durland answered
apologetically. &#8220;I rented a little room in the Billings
Power Building and am going to run a pattern and
model shop. I hope to get enough work right away
to pay the rent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will. Everybody who knows anything
about the machinery business knows you&#8217;re the
inventor of the only good things Cummings-Durland
make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve changed the name of the company now,&#8221;
Ethel remarked. &#8220;They&#8217;ve cut father&#8217;s name out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They changed the name in reorganizing the company,&#8221;
Durland explained patiently in his colorless
tone. &#8220;I had some loans the bank wouldn&#8217;t carry any
longer; stock I put up as collateral had to be sold and
Cummings bought it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man who will do a thing like that will be punished
for it; he won&#8217;t prosper,&#8221; said Ethel in a
curious, strained voice.</p>

<p>Durland frowned at his older daughter. Evidently
her remark was distasteful to him; he found no consolation
in the prediction that unseen powers would
punish Cummings for his perfidy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d probably have done the same thing if I&#8217;d been
in his place. Everything he turned down&mdash;my new
ideas, I mean&mdash;proved to be no good when I put
my own money into &#8217;em on the side. You&#8217;ve got
to be fair about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was clear that he set great store by the new shop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
The fact that he still had a place to work preserved
his self-respect. With a place in which to continue
his experiments he was not utterly condemned to the
scrap heap. He lifted his head and his jaws tightened.
Grace noted with pity these manifestations of a resurgence
of his courage. His laborious life, his few
interests outside the shop or more accurately the
private laboratory he had maintained for years in a
corner of the Cummings-Durland plant; his evenings
at home poring over scientific books and periodicals;
his mild unquestioning assent to everything his wife
proposed with reference to family affairs, all had their
pathos. She had always been aware that he had a
fondness for her that was not shared by Roy and
Ethel. Grace imagined that it was a disappointment
to her father that Roy had not manifested a mechanical
bent. In his gentle, unassertive fashion, Durland
had tried to curb the lad&#8217;s proneness to seek amusement,
to skimp his lessons&mdash;this in Roy&#8217;s high school
days; but Mrs. Durland had always been quick to
defend Roy; in her eyes he could do no wrong.</p>

<p>Ethel and her father were almost equally out of
sympathy. Ethel was intensely religious, zealous in
attendance upon a down-town church, a teacher in
its Sunday school and active in its young people&#8217;s
society. While Mrs. Durland had long been a member
of a West End church she was not particularly
religious; she believed there was good in all churches;
but she was proud of Ethel&#8217;s prominence in a church
whose membership was recruited largely from the
prosperous. Ethel was on important committees and
she was now and then a delegate to conventions of
church workers in other cities; the pastor called upon
her frequently and she had been asked to dinner at
the houses of wealthy members of the congregation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
though usually some church business inspired the invitation.
In a day when the frivolity of the new generation
was a subject of general lamentation, Ethel
could be pointed to as a pattern of sobriety and rectitude.
Durland had ceased going to church shortly
after his marriage and his wife had accounted to his
children for his apostacy on the ground of his scientific
learnings. He never discussed religion; indeed,
he rarely debated any question that rose in the family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland came bustling in carrying an apron
which she was hemstitching and the talk at once became
more animated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Cummings are in their new house on Washington
Boulevard, Grace. They&#8217;ve left the house on
Meridian they bought when they moved away from
here. They haven&#8217;t sold their place; they&#8217;ve leased it
for ninety-nine years to an automobile company.
We&#8217;re the only people on this block who were here
when your father bought this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel and her mother engaged in a long discussion
of the Cummings family, not neglecting to abuse Isaac
Cummings for his ungenerous conduct in dropping
Durland from the business. Meanwhile Durland
crossed and recrossed his short thin legs to express
his impatience or disapproval. Nothing interested him
less than the Cummings family history; and his elimination
from the old company was a closed incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob Cummings&#8217;s wife is certainly a pretty
woman,&#8221; continued Ethel. &#8220;She&#8217;s very popular, too.
You see her name nearly every day in the society
column. Bob was always so quiet; I wonder how he
likes being dragged about so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall always think,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Durland expansively,
&#8220;that if the Cummings hadn&#8217;t moved away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
when they did Bob and Grace might&mdash;well, I always
thought he liked you particularly, Grace, and you
were fond of him. Of course, he&#8217;s five years older,
but when you were still in high school and he was in
Yale he always came to see you and took you places
when he was home. But when they moved away
everything changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that didn&#8217;t amount to anything, mother,&#8221;
Grace replied carelessly. &#8220;He was always shy as a
boy and I suppose he still is. After they moved away
he didn&#8217;t know the girls out there so he hung on to
me for a while. He just used me to cover up his
diffidence among strange young people at country
club dances, and other places where he didn&#8217;t know
many people. When he got acquainted out there he
didn&#8217;t need me any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be like Hetty Cummings to tell him he&#8217;d
better cut his West End friends,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland
tartly. &#8220;Even back in Rangerton she was always
setting up to be better than most folks. It must have
been in their minds when they moved away that they
were going to force your father out of the business
and burn all the old bridges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The canal bridge,&#8221; remarked Grace with a little
laugh which the others ignored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Allie,&#8221; said Durland in mild protest, &#8220;they
didn&#8217;t force me out. It was losing my stock in the
company that put me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was merciless,&#8221; said Ethel, her voice rising,
&#8220;Cummings took advantage of you. He always knew
you were not a business man. Everything he&#8217;s got
came through your genius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he thought my genius was worn out,&mdash;and
he may be right about it,&#8221; said Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so foolish, daddy,&#8221; said Grace gently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
&#8220;Any day you may have an inspiration that will be
worth a lot of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always possible, of course,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland
with a little sigh susceptible of the interpretation that
she had no great confidence in her husband&#8217;s further
inspirations. &#8220;Ethel,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;tell Grace
about your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, please do, sis,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve just begun,&#8221; Ethel replied primly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know much about it myself. I&#8217;m in the Gregg
and Burley company; they&#8217;re one of the biggest insurance
agencies in town. Mr. Burley&#8217;s been ever so
nice to me. His little girl&#8217;s in my Sunday-school class.
Mrs. Burley asked me to a birthday party they had
for Louise last summer, so I really feel that I know
the family. I&#8217;m handling the telephone calls and doing
other little things till I get the run of the office. I&#8217;ve
started at eighteen a week but Mr. Burley says they&#8217;ll
raise me just as soon as I&#8217;m worth more. There are
six other girls in the office and one who&#8217;s been there
ten years get fifty a week and I don&#8217;t see how they
ever could get along without her. She knows more
about the details of the business than the members of
the firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds good,&#8221; said Grace warmly. &#8220;I suppose
there are women in business here who make large
salaries, far more than high school teachers or teachers
in colleges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought my girls would have to battle for
their bread,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always clung
to the old-fashioned idea that girls should stay with
their mothers till they married. Of course thousands
of splendid girls are at work in every kind of
business, but it&#8217;s hard for me to get used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why women shouldn&#8217;t work if they need
to or want to,&#8221; said Grace, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
things that&#8217;s settled; women can do anything they
please these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bring myself to see it,&#8221; Mrs. Durland replied,
&#8220;I remember that it seemed queer when my
father employed a woman stenographer in his office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, times have changed, mother,&#8221; Grace remarked.
&#8220;I have an idea that I can sell things; I
read an article in a magazine about the psychology
of salesmanship, and I have a strong hunch that that
would be a good field for me. The big stores must
be taking on more help at this season. I think I&#8217;ll see
what the chances are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace, surely you&#8217;re not in earnest!&#8221; cried Mrs.
Durland. &#8220;Of course we will need your help, but it
would be a lot better, considering your education, for
you to take up teaching or go into an office as Ethel&#8217;s
doing. It&#8217;s so much more in keeping with your bringing
up. It would break my heart to see you behind
a counter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland shifted uncomfortably in his chair as the
matter was discussed. For years he had lived his own
life, his thoughts centered constantly upon mechanical
projects. He was now confronted by the fact that as
the result of his intense preoccupation with tools,
metals and wood and his inattention and incapacity in
business he was hardly a factor in family affairs. He
listened almost as though he were a stranger in a
strange house, his guilt heavy upon him. He started
when Grace addressed him directly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, daddy, don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m right about trying
my arts of persuasion as a saleslady? I&#8217;ve always
loved that word! I think it would be fascinating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make it sound interesting,&#8221; said Durland cautiously,
after a timid glance at his wife. &#8220;I want you
to know it hurts me to think that you girls have got
to go to work. But as long as it can&#8217;t be helped I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
you to do the best you can for yourselves. You ought
to be sure you get into something where you&#8217;ll have a
chance to forward yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, daddy,&#8221; said Grace kindly. &#8220;I want to make
my time count. If I&#8217;m going to be a business woman
I mean to play the game for all I&#8217;m worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I simply couldn&#8217;t be reconciled to having you in
a store,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;An office would be
much more dignified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Grace can take care of herself,&#8221; Durland
ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; replied Mrs. Durland quickly, &#8220;we
can trust our girls anywhere. I was only thinking
of the annoyances. I&#8217;ve seen girls humiliated by floor-walkers&mdash;right
before customers, and it always makes
me boil. And I&#8217;m ashamed to say there are women
who are perfectly hateful to the clerks who wait on
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who&#8217;s afraid!&#8221; said Grace cheerfully. &#8220;School
teachers have a hard time too, with principals and
supervisors pecking at them all the time. Now that
I&#8217;m going out into the world I&#8217;m not going to ask any
special favors because I&#8217;m a woman. The day for
that&#8217;s all passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a pity it&#8217;s so!&#8221; declared Mrs. Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, I&#8217;m for taking the world as I find it!&#8221;
She glanced laughingly at her father who smiled
at her approvingly. In his undemonstrative way he
was relieved that Grace was meeting family
misfortunes so bravely. His courage was strengthened
by her very presence in the house. Prematurely
aged as he was, he rejoiced in her youth, her radiant
vitality, her good humor and high spirits. He followed
her with admiring eyes as she moved about the
room. She bent for a moment over the book he had
been reading, asked questions about it, drawing him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
out as to its nature and merits. He was as happy as
a boy when a sympathetic grown-up manifests an intelligent
interest in his toys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t be in too much of a hurry about
going to work, Grace,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
serious matter for you and all of us. Perhaps Ethel
could make some suggestions. Some of her church
friends might be able to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to do anything I can,&#8221; Ethel murmured
without looking up from her sewing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks; I&#8217;ll certainly call on you if I see any
place where you can help. I&#8217;ve been thinking about it
ever since I got mother&#8217;s letter, and I believe I&#8217;ll call
up Irene Kirby right now and make an appointment
to see her tomorrow. She&#8217;s been in Shipley&#8217;s ever
since she left high school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Grace, please don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; protested Mrs.
Durland, &#8220;you must take time to consider your future.
Irene&#8217;s people are very ordinary and I never liked
your intimacy with her when you went to school together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother, Irene&#8217;s one of the finest girls I ever
knew! She was a good student in high school and
certainly behaved herself. She can tell me all about
Shipley&#8217;s and the chances of getting in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it at all, Grace,&#8221; replied Mrs. Durland.
&#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough having my daughters going down
town to work but I&#8217;d hate having you ask favors
of a girl like Irene Kirby. I don&#8217;t see why you can&#8217;t
wait a little and let Ethel help you find something
more suitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it won&#8217;t do any harm to see Irene and talk
to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard her voice at the telephone in the hall
and caught scraps of her lively talk with Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace is so headstrong,&#8221; Mrs. Durland sighed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
&#8220;And you never can tell how anything&#8217;s going to strike
her. I&#8217;m always amazed at her inconsistencies. She&#8217;s
the last girl in the world you&#8217;d think would want
to work in a department store. She isn&#8217;t that type at
all. Stephen, I wish you&#8217;d put your foot down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland looked at his wife blankly, trying to recall
any other instance where he had been asked to put
his foot down. If he had been a man of mirth he
might have laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace ain&#8217;t going to do anything foolish; you can
trust Grace,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Irene say?&#8221; asked Ethel when Grace
came back from the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am going to have lunch with her tomorrow
at the store and she&#8217;ll tell me everything,&#8221; said Grace
carelessly. &#8220;Well, daddy, it&#8217;s about time for the
regular evening apple.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a plate of apples on the table with a knife
beside it, and Durland, pleased that she remembered
his habit of eating an apple before going to bed, took
one she chose for him and peeled it with care, tossing
the unbroken peeling into the grate.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>As Grace and her mother washed the dishes and
made the beds the next morning Mrs. Durland recurred
to the ill fortune that had brought Grace home
from the university. Repetition was a habit with her,
and she explained again and with more detail the manner
in which Cummings had thrust her husband out
of Cummings-Durland. She praised the spirit in which
Ethel had met the situation&mdash;all this as a prelude to
another plea that Grace should plan her future with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
care and not take the first employment that offered.
One of these days the right man would come along
and she would marry; Mrs. Durland hoped that both
her daughters would marry good men and keep up the
traditions of the American home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve never felt that I&#8217;d marry,&#8221; Grace replied.
&#8220;The reason I went to college was to fit myself
to be something in the world; and now that I&#8217;ve
got to begin over again I&#8217;m going to experiment a
little. I may try a lot of things before I find something
that suits me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Grace, you know I&#8217;ve done the best I could
for all you children. When my time comes to go I
want to know that you are all happy and well placed
in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother; you&#8217;ve been wonderful to all of us.
And I want you to be sure I&#8217;m not bitter about anything.
You and father have always done the best
you could for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a clear, crisp morning and Grace decided
to walk the short distance to the business district.
Her buoyant step expressed her lightness of spirit;
never had she felt so well, never had she been so sure
of herself. She was convinced that it was only her
pride that had suffered in the sudden termination of
her college life and that the blow was not to any
lofty ideal that she had erected for herself. The
thought of freedom fascinated her. Her mother&#8217;s constant
lament that the world was not what it used to be
and that the change was not all for the better only
piqued her curiosity. While the university had thrown
its protecting arm about her she had not thought of
perils or dangers; they were only the subject of tedious
warnings by pessimists who had despaired of youth in
all ages. But now that she had been thrust into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
world she refused to be appalled by hints of unseen
dangers; the fact that they were only hints, intimations,
vague insinuations, only increased her incredulity
while creating a wonder in her mind as to their
exact nature. She was afraid of nothing; dared everything.</p>

<p>A car screeched discordantly as it negotiated a turn
on its way into the interurban station. She noted the
faces of the passengers at the windows&mdash;country folk
and small town people&mdash;and felt her comradeship with
them. She had once heard the president of the university
say that the state was like a big neighborhood
of cheerful, industrious, aspiring people, and the
thought pleased her.</p>

<p>To Grace the capital city of her native state was
merely an aggregation of three hundred and some odd
thousand people. The rust-colored dome of the State
House and the majestic shaft of the Soldier&#8217;s and
Sailor&#8217;s Monument connoted history and implied
changes that were to influence and affect her as a child
of the commonwealth; but she was only vaguely conscious
of them. It was her fate to become an active
member of the community at a time when elderly citizens,
who professed to believe that nothing had
changed since the last wild turkey was shot within the
town&#8217;s original mile square, found themselves walking
from the post office to the old Bates House site without
meeting a single acquaintance. The languor that
for years gave Indianapolis a half-southern air was
gone. Here indeed was abundant material for the
student of change.</p>

<p>Still a sprawling country town at the end of the
Civil War, Indianapolis was booming gaily when the
panic of &#8217;73 punished it for its temerity. The few conservative
capitalists who patiently sawed wood while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the bubbles were bursting had money to invest when
the Eastern insurance companies began foreclosing
their mortgages on the best corners. Such banks as
survived established new low records of refrigeration.
Newcomers, stupidly desirous of initiating new enterprises,
were chilled by their reception. Melancholy
recollections of the panic of &#8217;73 were long a sufficient
excuse for restricted credits. Not going to take any
chances! As a matter of fact they never had taken
any, those cautious souls, and in the trail of the whirlwind
they had gathered enough spoil to enrich themselves
a thousand fold. Stinginess nobly standardized
by a few merely, one might think, that the generous of
hand and spirit might shine the more effulgently. The
town got by the pinching times of &#8217;84 and &#8217;93 and continued
to grow right along until the automobile craze
arrived with a resulting multiplication of smokestacks.
With the old guard, and such portions of a new generation
as had been intimidated by its caution, sitting
in pigeon-toed fear predicting calamity, the growth
persisted.</p>

<p>Prosperity began to wear strange faces; the old-timers
didn&#8217;t know the new people or pretended they
didn&#8217;t. Many of these new folk who rolled over the
asphalt in large expensive limousines didn&#8217;t go to
church at all. A singular thing. Once it hadn&#8217;t been
respectable to abstain from church. Spectacle of perfectly
good citizens riding gaily to the country clubs
on Sunday morning without fear of eternal damnation.
Churches moving uptown, or those that clung to their
old sites trying valiantly to adjust themselves to changing
spiritual needs.</p>

<p>Sentiment&mdash;oodles and scads of sentiment about the
town and its people! Visitors expected to confess that
here throbs a different atmosphere&mdash;an ampler ether, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
diviner air. Politics, no end. Statesmen and stateswomen
everywhere visible. Families torn asunder by
the battles of the primaries. A political bomb hidden
under the socks in every darning basket. The fine
arts not neglected. An honest interest, dating back
to the founders, in bookish things; every mail box a
receptacle for manuscript. Riley in Lockerbie street
thrumming his lyre with the nation for audience.</p>

<p>No reason why any one should go friendless or stray
from the straight and narrow path in a town so solidly
based on the ten commandments, except that the percentage
of the wayward seems bound to grow with a
mounting population, particularly when the biggest
war in all creation comes along and jars most disturbingly
all the props of civilization. Changes! Changes
of course, not local as to cause and effect, but part of
the general onward sweep of the Time-Spirit impelled
by gasoline to jazzy music.</p>

<p>In so far as she paid any attention to the talk
about changes that she had heard at home and at the
university, Grace believed it was all for good; that it
was well to be done with hypocrisy, cant, prudishness;
that a frank recognition of evil rather than an attempt
to cloak it marked a distinct advance. When she
was about nine her mother had rebuked her severely
for using the word leg; a leg was a limb and not vulgarly
to be referred to as a leg. The use of leg when
leg was meant was still considered vulgar by fairly
broad-minded folk in the corn-belt, probably as late
as 1906&mdash;if one may attempt to fix a date for so
momentous a matter.</p>

<p>Grace Durland was no more responsible for the
changes going on about her than her parents had been
for the changes of their day. They had witnessed the
passing of the hoop-skirt and red flannel underwear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the abandonment of the asafetida bag as a charm
against infection, and other follies innumerable. Boys
and girls had once stolen down the back stairs or
brazenly lied to gain an evening of freedom; now the
only difference was that they demanded&mdash;and received&mdash;a
key to the front door. Civilization will hardly go
to smash over the question of a girl&#8217;s refusal to wear a
corset or her insistence on her right to roll her stockings.
The generation of Grace Durland isn&#8217;t responsible
for changes that began the day after creation
and started all over again after the flood and will continue
right on to the end of all things.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The last of a number of errands she had undertaken
for her mother brought Grace to Shipley&#8217;s a little
before twelve. She observed the young women who
waited on her with a particular attention inspired by
the feeling that she too might soon be standing behind
a counter. Some of the clerks at Shipley&#8217;s were
women well advanced in middle life, whom she remembered
from her earliest visits to the establishment.
These veterans contributed to Shipley&#8217;s reputation for
solidity and permanence. They enjoyed the friendly
acquaintance of many customers, who relied upon their
counsel in their purchases. There were many more
employees of this type in Shipley&#8217;s than in any other
establishment in town; they were an asset, a testimony
to the consideration shown the employees, the
high character of the owners. Grace&#8217;s imagination
played upon her own future: what if she should find
herself in ten or twenty years behind a counter, ambition
and hope dead in her and nothing ahead but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the daily exhibition of commodities and the making
out of sale slips!</p>

<p>But this cloud was only the tiniest speck on her
horizon. She had already set a limit upon the time
she would spend in such a place if her services were
accepted; it was the experience she wanted, and when
she had exhausted the possibilities of Shipley&#8217;s or some
similar place she meant to carry her pitcher of curiosity
to other fountains.</p>

<p>While waiting for Irene outside the lunch room she
found amusement in watching the shoppers, studying
them, determining their financial and social status.
Some one had told her that she was endowed with
special gifts for appraising character, and she had the
conceit of her inexperience as a student of the human
kind. Her speculations as to the passers-by were interrupted
by the arrival of Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly wonderful to see you again! I was
that delighted to hear your voice over the wire last
night. You&#8217;re looking marvelous! I always adored
your gypsy effect! Come along&mdash;there&#8217;s a particular
table in a far corner they keep for me and we can
buzz for just one hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had put on her coat and hat, to disguise the
fact, she explained, that she was one of Shipley&#8217;s hired
hands. She was a tall blonde, with a wealth of
honey-colored hair, china blue eyes and a dear brilliant
complexion. Grace&#8217;s admiration, dating from
high school days, quickened as she noted the girl&#8217;s
ease and the somewhat scornful air with which she
inspected the lunch card. Irene&#8217;s father was a locomotive
engineer and the family lived in a comfortable
house on a pleasant street in the East End, not far
from the railway shops. Irene had brothers and sisters,
but they did not share her good looks or her social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
qualities. Irene met the rest of the world with a lofty
condescension which fell short of being insufferable
only by reason of her good humor. Selfishness with
Irene was almost a virtue, it manifested itself so candidly.
She had no intention of being bored, or of
putting herself out. Ugliness and clumsiness were
repugnant to her. Disagreeable things did not trouble
her because she had schooled herself not to see them.
She was clever, adroit, resourceful, and wise with the
astonishing worldly-wisdom that is the heritage of the
children of the Twentieth Century. In school she had
been a fair scholar but the grand manner and a ready
wit had assisted her even there. When puzzled by
Irene&#8217;s ability to dress better than most of her girl
companions in the high school, Grace had been impressed
by the revelation that Irene made her own
clothes and could retouch last year&#8217;s hat with a genius
that brought it into conformity with the latest and
most exclusive designs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You still have the same queenly look, Irene,&#8221;
Grace remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queenly nothing! You&#8217;re nearly as tall as I am
and I haven&#8217;t a thing on you when it comes to hauteur.
I suppose the Lord made me tall and gave me square
shoulders just to hang clothes on for women with
money to look at. I wish I had your black hair. Being
a blonde is an awful handicap if you&#8217;re doomed to
work for a living. And a complexion like mine, which
is called good by experts, is a nuisance. I&#8217;ve refused
an offer about once a month to go on the road selling
and demonstrating cosmetics. Can you see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I supposed you&#8217;d be married before this, Irene.
You must have had loads of chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chances but not opportunities,&#8221; replied Irene with
a shrug. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;ve quit college to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
married; it&#8217;s not a professor, I hope! I&#8217;d hate to see
you sacrificing yourself in the noble cause of education.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like that. I quit because we&#8217;re broke&mdash;father
couldn&#8217;t afford to keep me in college any longer.
Some one had to drop out and as Roy has only a
year more in the law school it seemed better for him
to keep on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy?&#8221; Irene repeated the name languidly as
though Roy were a negligible figure in the affairs of
the Durlands.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; Irene&#8217;s eyes lighted as with some memory.
&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;brothers do rather have the best of it,
don&#8217;t they? But it&#8217;s too bad you couldn&#8217;t finish.
You&#8217;re just the type of girl that ought to be rounded
out at college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right; I&#8217;m rather glad to be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d dreamed of seeing you land high as a
writer or something like that. I&#8217;ll hand you this right
now: women can&#8217;t know too much these days. It&#8217;s
a big advantage to a woman to know how to talk to
men; I don&#8217;t mean the pool room boys but the real
men&mdash;the men who draw the large mazuma. They
have the brains themselves and they respect the same
ingredient in girls, a lot of silly ideas to the contrary
notwithstanding. Just by knowing Thackeray I&#8217;m
the assistant manager of the ready-to-wear department
of this spacious emporium&mdash;the youngest assistant
in the house. Funny, but it&#8217;s true!&#8221;</p>

<p>Asked for an elucidation of the statement, Irene explained
that the general superintendent of Shipley&#8217;s,
who had power of life and death over everything pertaining
to the establishment, was Thackeray-mad.
Learning this she had carelessly referred to &#8220;Becky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Sharp&#8221; in a chance conversation with him in the elevator
on a day when he deigned to notice her. In a
week she had been called to his office and promoted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t imagine he was leading up to anything;
he&#8217;s a gentleman with a wife and three children and
teaches a Sunday-school class. But he yearns to talk
to some one&mdash;any one who has a scrap of interest in
Thackeray. His wife invited me to their house for
Sunday dinner awhile back and I was never so bored
in my life. But I did manage to show an intelligent
interest in his library, so I guess I&#8217;ll hold my job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene had finished at the high school two years
before Grace, but the difference in their ages was not
to be calculated in years. Irene had always seemed
to Grace to be endowed with the wisdom of all the
centuries.</p>

<p>&#8220;About those correspondence courses, Grace,&#8221; Irene
was saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had most of the stuff on the schedule
of that English course I wrote you about. I
wouldn&#8217;t read Carlyle&#8217;s &#8216;Heroes and Hero-worship&#8217;
again for a farm in Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or Bacon&#8217;s &#8216;Novum Organum&#8217;,&#8221; groaned Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I&#8217;m concentrating on French. You know
I had French in high school, and I&#8217;m keeping it up
in the hope the house will send me to Paris next year.
You know Shipley&#8217;s is one of the most progressive
houses in the whole west; they certainly do treat you
white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s not wildly enthusiastic about my going
into a store. You know mother; she thinks&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Irene caught her up, &#8220;she thinks it&#8217;s not
as respectable as working in an office or teaching
a kindergarten. I met Ethel on the street the other
day and she told me she&#8217;d taken a place with an insurance
firm. That&#8217;s all right for Ethel but no good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
for you. I looked over the office game before I
decided to come here and there&#8217;s nothing to it, my
dear. You can make a good thing of this if you have
selling talent. My salary is nothing to speak of but
I get a bonus&mdash;I drew seventy-five dollars last week
and I expect to hit the hundred mark before Christmas.
They steer the customers who look like real money
to me. When you&#8217;ve learned the trick you can make
them think it&#8217;s a disgrace not to buy the highest
priced thing we carry. The women from the country
towns whose husbands have grabbed the water power
on &#8217;Possum creek or foreclosed on ninety per cent
of the farmers in the township, bring said husbands
along and they are the easiest. I throw the wrap or
whatever it is on my own stately person, then clap
it on the wife and hubby doesn&#8217;t dare let his wife
suspect he doesn&#8217;t think her as much of a Venus de
Milo as I am! A modest little violet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Irene!&#8221; cried Grace, enchanted with her
friend&#8217;s wisdom.</p>

<p>She marveled at Irene&#8217;s poise, and envied her the
light ironic flick she gave to the business of bargain
and sale. Irene complained in the most ladylike manner
of the chicken salad, which Grace had thought
very good. The head-waitress listened respectfully
and offered to substitute something else, but Irene declined,
with the indifference of one to whom petty annoyances
are merely incidental and to be mentioned
merely for the good of the service.</p>

<p>As they ate their chocolate eclairs Grace became
impatient to broach the matter of her own ambition
to become a factor in Shipley&#8217;s, but it seemed a pity
to break in upon Irene, who went on tranquilly discussing
their old companions of high school days. Presently,
after paying the checks, she brought her wrist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
watch within range of her eyes with a graceful gesture,
and disposed of the matter with characteristic ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spoken to Miss Lupton&mdash;she manages our employment
bureau&mdash;about you. She&#8217;s a very good
friend of mine; and I mentioned you to Miss Boardman,
the head of my department. I didn&#8217;t wait to ask
where you&#8217;d rather be; but of course I&#8217;d like to have
you with me. I can&#8217;t just see you in the toilet goods
or infants&#8217; wear. They&#8217;re pretty full in all departments,
but I think I&#8217;ve got you fixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Irene&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All you do is to fill out an application blank&mdash;they
always require that&mdash;and give two references.
You&#8217;ve had no experience, but your figure and general
intelligence will more than balance that. They do
their best to keep the standard high and it won&#8217;t be
lost on them that you&#8217;re of good family and have taken
a whirl at college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly obliged to you, Irene. I didn&#8217;t know
it would be as easy as this&mdash;but&#8221;&mdash;she laughed, &#8220;they
haven&#8217;t seen me yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fish! Your appearance is nothing to complain
of; you know that as well as I do. It will be
fine to have you where we can talk and play together
as we did in school. Between us we ought to be able
to give tone to our end of the shop!&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Miss Lupton received Grace amiably, asked her a
few questions, and pushed a blank toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We always require this; it&#8217;s just a matter of routine,&#8221;
she explained, and as Grace filled in the blank
she looked at Irene and nodded her approval of the
candidate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Miss Boardman, a woman of forty, short, plump and
brisk in manner and speech, surveyed Grace with full
appreciation, remarking that Miss Kirby had covered
all the details.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be ready for you Monday morning,&#8221; she said.
Then she directed Irene&#8217;s attention to a lady who had,
she explained, inspected all the garments in the shop
and still lingered, a prey to uncertainty. &#8220;Miss Flagg
doesn&#8217;t seem to be getting anywhere with that woman.
It&#8217;s a Mrs. Bascomb from up in the state somewhere&mdash;Muncie
or Anderson, or maybe Delphi. She&#8217;s a
new customer and the fussiest person I ever saw.
Maybe you can help Miss Flagg, Miss Kirby, but be
careful not to rattle her. Very glad to know you, Miss
Durland. You will begin at twelve fifty; Miss Kirby
will explain about the bonuses and other little things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch me work,&#8221; said Irene, her eyes upon Miss
Flagg&#8217;s customer. &#8220;You can sit right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without taking off her coat and hat Irene walked
toward the customer and clerk who were evidently in
a hopeless deadlock. Grace saw the slight gesture with
which Irene signalled to Miss Flagg. The import of
the signal was evidently that Miss Flagg was to continue
her attentions to the lady from Muncie, Anderson
or Delphi while Irene idly examined the garments
heaped on a table, with which Miss Flagg had
been tempting her difficult shopper. Irene picked
out a coat, held it at arm&#8217;s length, and slipped it on.
Walking to a glass she passed back and forth the
better to observe the effect of the garment upon her
own person.</p>

<p>Miss Flagg&#8217;s customer became interested, watching
Irene enviously, and the moment the girl divested herself
of the garment she took it up. The lady from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Muncie, Anderson or Delphi exchanged a few words
with Irene; and again Irene put on the coat. Irene
was soon discussing with her the merits of other raiment
which Miss Flagg produced from the show cabinets.
Grace watched intently, hearing nothing of the
talk of the trio, but interpreting the pantomime. Irene
had evidently assumed the role of adviser in the delicate
matter of the lady&#8217;s choice. Presently she took
off her hat, disclosing the fact that she was a member
of the selling staff of the establishment. Two gowns
having been added to the wrap and the lady from
the more northern provinces having been escorted to
the fitting room, Irene returned to Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six hundred dollars worth,&#8221; she said, flicking a
raveling from her sleeve. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay on the job till she&#8217;s
given her shipping order. Miss Flagg is one of our
best saleswomen; but she just didn&#8217;t hit it off with
that woman. They were both tired and irritating each
other. If I&#8217;d butted in and taken her away from Miss
Flagg that would have spoiled everything. I saved the
day by pretending I wasn&#8217;t interested in her at all;
but now she knows I belong here and she wants me to
come back to the fitting room and make sure her
things are all right. All she needed was a little coaxing
and the right kind of flattery. You&#8217;d better not
wait unless you want to watch the show a while.
There&#8217;s a convention of women&#8217;s clubs in town and
we&#8217;re likely to be rushed this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run along,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;And thank you ever
so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>On her way to the elevator she passed a clerk who
was patiently answering the questions of a captious
customer as to the merits of a garment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about this,&#8221; said the woman pecking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
at the silk lining in the sleeve; &#8220;it looks cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference, lady,&#8221; exclaimed the girl,
&#8220;nobody&#8217;s going to notice the lining.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace smiled. The girl&#8217;s phrase fastened itself in
her memory. &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference, lady?&#8221; It was
susceptible of many interpretations and applications
not related to suits that sold for $19.50.</p>

<p>She left the store elated, feeling herself already an
essential unit of Shipley&#8217;s. The great lower room
seemed larger than when she had entered. She went
into the book department and idled over the counters,
opening volumes that roused her interest. She had no
intention of relinquishing her interest in bookish things.
She would test life, probe into the heart of things, but
she would hold fast to all that she had gained in her
two years at the university. She had been impressed
by what the worldly-wise Irene had said of the value
of a little learning in getting on. She meant to propose
to her friend that they attack French together;
and there were many lines of reading she intended
to pursue with a view to covering the more important
cultural courses which she had been obliged to abandon.
Grace rejoiced in her sense of freedom; she was
tremendously sure of herself.</p>

<p>When she reached home her mother was leaving for
the first fall meeting of the West End Literary Club
which had held together for years in spite of the deterioration
of the neighborhood. Mrs. Durland made
much of her loyalty to the organization, of which she
had been the founder. While her old friends had
dropped out when they moved away she thought it
her duty to fill up the membership with new arrivals
in the neighborhood. Women needed the inspiration
of just such a society. She had enrolled a number
of young married women, some of them hardly more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
than transients domiciled in boarding houses, with a
view to keeping them in touch with the best thought
of the world. Ethel, sharing her mother&#8217;s interest in
all movements and devices for uplift, had acted as her
scout in discovering these recruits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Grace, I hope&mdash;&#8221; Mrs. Durland began, gathering
up a number of magazines she was carrying to
the meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done gone and done it, mother! I go to work
at Shipley&#8217;s Monday morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid you would,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland with a
sigh. &#8220;You&#8217;re so headstrong, Grace. With a little
patience we&#8217;d have found something more suitable&mdash;more
in keeping&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I may not like it. If I don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll change to
something else, so please don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland had mislaid a glove; the loss of it
overshadowed immediately her daughter&#8217;s grievous
error in accepting employment in a department store.
Grace found the glove and held the magazines while
her mother drew it on.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old security, the reticences and decencies of
life have passed,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. Grace suspected
that her mother was quoting from a magazine article
or a club paper. She declined an urgent invitation
to go to the meeting; she wanted to look over her
clothes, she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll not give up your interest in literature
now that you&#8217;re going to work. You should save a little
time every day for self-culture. There are some
new books on that line I want you to read. I sometimes
think the poorer we are the more we lean on the
things of the spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already decided to do some studying,&#8221; said
Grace, who at the moment didn&#8217;t feel the need of leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
on anything. She was relieved that her mother,
preoccupied with the club meeting, had so lightly
passed over the matter of her engagement at Shipley&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m not back at five-thirty, put on that pot-roast,&#8221;
said Mrs. Durland from the door. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
fixed in the ice-box. And if that collector comes about
the coal bill tell him I&#8217;ll call at the office the next
time I&#8217;m down town. That last load we had was full
of slate and I&#8217;m not going to pay the bill till they
make it right.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWO</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I mustn&#8217;t</span> seem to be too much interested in you,&#8221;
said Irene when Grace reported for duty at Shipley&#8217;s
on Monday morning. &#8220;I can&#8217;t play favorites and it
wouldn&#8217;t do to make the other girls jealous. The first
few days everything will seem strange but all you have
to do is to stand around and keep your eyes open. Be
nice to everybody&mdash;that&#8217;s the card to play. One girl
in a department can make all the rest uncomfortable.
Miss Boardman&#8217;s a little sharp sometimes&mdash;but never
talk back! She knows her business and prides herself
on keeping away ahead of her quota of sales. The
management is strong for <i>esprit de corps</i> and there&#8217;s a
social club that&#8217;s supposed to promote that sort of
thing. There&#8217;ll be a few dances during the winter and
a theatre party and a few little things like that. You
won&#8217;t mind them. They&#8217;re really good fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was number eighteen. Her investiture with
a number was the only real shock she experienced in
taking her place in Shipley&#8217;s. One of her new associates
who was instructing her in the routine, which began
with inspection of the stock, tightening of buttons,
the repair of minor damages incurred in the handling
of garments, addressed her casually as &#8220;Eighteen&#8221; as
though that had been Grace&#8217;s name bestowed in baptism.
For an instant Grace resented her numerical
designation; it was almost as though she had been
robbed of her identity. Miss Boardman had given her
a quick looking over to satisfy herself that the new employee
met the store&#8217;s requirements as to raiment. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
nodded her approval of the frock of dark taffeta which
Grace had worn to simple afternoon affairs at college
and told her to watch the other girls and lend a hand
where she could.</p>

<p>Miss Boardman was beyond question a person of
strong executive talent. Though burdened with much
desk work as the head of the department, nothing
escaped her watchful eye on the floor confided to her
care. By eleven o&#8217;clock the ready-to-wear presented
a scene of greatest animation. The day was
fine and a throng of out-of-town customers, lured by
double page advertisements of fall apparel in the
newspapers, were attacking the department in dauntless
battalions. Grace was constantly on the alert,
keeping the much-examined stock in order, conducting
customers to the trying-on room, and otherwise making
herself useful to the experienced clerks.</p>

<p>A spectacled old lady fortified with a handbag appeared
and surveyed the scene of confusion with dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen, see what that lady wants,&#8221; said Miss
Boardman as she hurried by.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, please, that I can show you?&#8221; asked
Grace, feeling her heart thump as she realized that she
had accosted her first customer. She smiled encouragingly
and the old lady returned the smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want two suits&mdash;a gray and a blue, cut as nearly
like this thing I have on as possible. I&#8217;ve written
my exact measurements on this card, so don&#8217;t jump
at me with a tape-line. And I want a plain long
coat for rough weather&mdash;something serviceable and
unfashionable. You <i>look</i> like an intelligent girl, so
I don&#8217;t expect you to show me anything in red or green.
And don&#8217;t tell me what they&#8217;re wearing in Paris, London
or New York&mdash;, as though <i>I</i> cared! I pay cash,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
so there&#8217;ll be no time lost in looking up my credit
card.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace placed a chair for her singular customer, took
hurried counsel of Irene and was soon in the throes of
her first sale. The little old lady asked few questions
but her inquiries were much to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me only good quality,&#8221; she said, tossing aside
a skirt after asking its price. &#8220;You know perfectly
well it can&#8217;t be wool for that money, and the color
will run the first time it gets rained on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; began Grace, &#8220;is genuine home-spun, hand-wove&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better. This will do for the blue. Find
a gray of similar style.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gray was more difficult than the blue. She
hadn&#8217;t wanted a mixed weave but a plain gray, which
was not in stock. Grace warmed to her work, praising
the quality of a gray with a misty heather mixture.
Holding the coat at arm&#8217;s length and becoming
eloquent as to the fine quality of the garment, Grace
turned to find the customer regarding her with a whimsical
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, you do that very well. How long
have you been here?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>Grace colored. &#8220;This is my first day,&#8221; she confessed.
The old lady seemed greatly amused at her
discomfiture. Her alert eyes brightened behind her
glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I your first customer? Well, you&#8217;re going
to get on. You&#8217;ve made me change my mind and not
many people ever do that. That heather tone really
pleases me better than the plain smooth cloth I had in
mind and I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The customer explained that she walked in all weathers,
and wanted warmth, not style, in the topcoat with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
loose sleeves which she described succinctly. Grace
produced half a dozen such coats, one of which her
customer chose immediately. She slipped it on, said
the sleeves were too short, and Irene passing along
opportunely said that nothing could be easier than
to let out the sleeve the required two inches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure she&#8217;s perfectly satisfied before she leaves,&#8221;
whispered Irene. &#8220;She looks like real money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady who looked like real money was watching
attentively an evening gown which was being displayed
before a smartly-dressed young woman on the
further side of the room. She drew out a memorandum
book and turned over the leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait a moment to see whether that woman over
there buys that gown. You might find out the measurements,
if it will do for a thirty-six I&#8217;ll take it for a
niece of mine in Evansville. She&#8217;s very fond of that
rose color.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rose colored gown was rejected a moment later
by the lady who had been considering it and Grace
laid it before her customer.</p>

<p>&#8220;My niece is just about your height and build, and
has your coloring. I&#8217;d like to see that on you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace asked the nearest clerk whether there was any
objection to meeting this unlooked for request. Certainly
not, though there was a model for such purposes.
The old lady who looked like real money didn&#8217;t
care to see the model in the gown and frankly said so.
She expressed her gratification when Grace paraded
before her in the gray and ivory fitting room. The
price was three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace got out of the gown as quickly as possible,
and presented the garments already chosen for final
approval. The old lady who looked like real money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
produced from her satchel a checkbook and a fountain
pen.</p>

<p>The total was six hundred and ninety dollars. Grace
regarded the bit of paper with awe; it was the largest
check she had ever seen. The customer wrote out
the shipping directions for her niece&#8217;s gown, screwed
the cap on her pen, took the cash-sale slip Grace
gave her and tucked it carefully away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been very nice to me. Thank you very
much.&#8221; She smilingly extended her hand. &#8220;Let this
be a little secret between us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The secret was a ten dollar bill. The little old
lady who really didn&#8217;t look like real money was already
in the elevator and Grace turned with relief to Irene,
who inspected the office end of the cash-sale slip, and
read aloud the signature on the check.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beulah Reynolds&mdash;you certainly drew a prize! I
never saw her before but you&#8217;ve heard of her. She
belongs to the old Hoosier nobility. Her people landed
before the Indians left. She&#8217;s lived all over the world
and has just come back here and bought a house on
Washington Boulevard. I read a piece about her in
the paper. If she tipped you ten dollars it&#8217;s a good
sign. Don&#8217;t you be squeamish about taking tips&mdash;it&#8217;s
all perfectly right and it won&#8217;t happen often. Don&#8217;t
let your good luck turn your head; there&#8217;s a lady
coming now who looks as though she lived on lemons.
Pass the sugar and see what you can do with her.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mrs. Durland was greatly distressed that a daughter
of hers should have met Miss Beulah Reynolds in what
she was pleased to term a servile capacity. Miss Reynolds
was a personage, she said&mdash;a Colonial Dame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
a D. A. R. and everything else that implied noble
American ancestry. Mrs. Durland had met her at a
tea, which she described with minute detail. It was
in Harrison&#8217;s administration, she thought, though it
might have been in the second consulship of Cleveland.
That a lady so distinguished and wealthy should have
given Grace ten dollars quite as though she were a
waitress was humiliating. Miss Reynolds would never
have thought of tipping the daughter of Alicia Morley
Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m number Eighteen to all the world when I&#8217;m
at Shipley&#8217;s,&#8221; Grace replied good-naturedly. &#8220;If I&#8217;d
told her in a burst of confidence that I was your daughter
she probably wouldn&#8217;t have given me the ten which
I sorely need. She was nice as possible and I didn&#8217;t
see anything wrong in taking her money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course she meant to be kind, dear; but it
hurts me just a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanks to Mrs. Reynolds&#8217; generous purchases,
Grace&#8217;s envelope for the first week contained $35.21.
Though warned by Irene that this was beginner&#8217;s
luck she was satisfied that she could master the selling
art and earn a good income.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the gift, my dear. You&#8217;ll build up a
line of regular customers,&#8221; Irene expatiated, &#8220;who&#8217;ll always
ask for you, and that&#8217;s what counts. I notice
that a good many customers already pick you out
and refuse to be steered to the other girls at your end
of the room. All due to your <i>beaux yeux</i>, as we say
in Paris, and general air of being somebody in particular.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace quickly made friends in the store, both in
and out of her own department. Two members of
her sorority, who like herself had been obliged to leave
college before finishing, sought her out; an alumna of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the state university, a woman of thirty, who was
employed in the office as auditor, took her to lunch;
a charming English woman, stranded in America and
plying her needle in the alteration room, brought her
books to read. Miss Vail at the glove counter knew
all there was to know about palmistry, table-tipping
and automatic writing and aroused Grace&#8217;s curiosity
as to the mysteries of the ouija board.</p>

<p>To break the monotony of her evenings, Grace asked
Miss Vail and two other girls from the store to the
house for some experiments. She had not announced
in advance that the purpose of the meeting was to
probe into the unknown, and had counted on Ethel&#8217;s
assistance in entertaining her friends; but when the
ouija board was produced Ethel expressed a chilling
disapproval of ouija and everything else pertaining to
the occult. Mrs. Durland, anxious to promote harmony,
suggested that they read aloud an article in a
late magazine that explained ouija writing and similar
phenomena. Of course Grace and her friends did
not want scientific explanations of ouija; they wanted
to see the thing work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much unhappiness may be caused by such things,&#8221;
said Mrs. Durland; &#8220;and of course they mean nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always felt,&#8221; remarked Ethel, &#8220;that there&#8217;s
something just a little vulgar about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, piffle!&#8221; exclaimed Grace impatiently. &#8220;We
all know it&#8217;s a joke; we just wanted to have a little
fun out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother, Grace,&#8221; said Miss Vail. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just
forget about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen Durland, who had changed his clothes in
honor of Grace&#8217;s party, broke his silence to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any harm in those things. They&#8217;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
all explained on scientific grounds. I think it would
be interesting to watch it work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It probably wouldn&#8217;t work in such an atmosphere,&#8221;
said Grace, thoroughly irritated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland with sudden inspiration,
&#8220;you girls make fudge! I&#8217;ll get the things ready.
I never saw a girl yet who didn&#8217;t like fudge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something had to be done to amuse the guests
and Grace assented. Ethel, however, did not participate
in the fudge making, but took herself off to bed.
Grace resolved never again to ask any one to the house.
She said as much to Ethel the next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to forget that I pay my board here and
help with the housework, too. I ought to have a few
privileges. Those are as nice girls as I ever knew and
you and mother drove us into the kitchen as though
we were a lot of silly children. You&#8217;re certainly the
queen of the kill-joys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think,&#8221; said Ethel, regarding her sister
pityingly, &#8220;that with your education you&#8217;d be above
putting yourself on the level with the cheap people
who patronize fortune-tellers. People who really have
faith that there&#8217;s a life to come don&#8217;t <i>need</i> such things.
They have no place in a Christian home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace stared at her helplessly. Ethel was an
enigma; it was incredible that any one could feel so
intensely about so small a matter, or find so complete
a joy in making others uncomfortable.</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Durland</span>, no doubt to show her sympathetic
interest in her daughters&#8217; labors, asked innumerable
questions every evening when the family gathered at
the supper table. As Ethel&#8217;s experiences were much
less interesting than Grace&#8217;s, the burden of these conversations
fell largely upon Grace. Whenever Grace
mentioned some customer her mother or Ethel knew or
knew about, that person was subjected to the most
searching analysis. It was incredible that they could
be so interested in people of whom they knew only
from reading of their social activities in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Ethel&#8217;s preoccupations with her church and philanthropic
affairs took her away several evenings in the
week, and at such times Grace played checkers or sniff
with her father while Mrs. Durland read or sewed.
The fact that Grace&#8217;s earnings averaged higher than
Ethel&#8217;s made it necessary for Mrs. Durland to soothe
any feeling the older daughter manifested as to this
disparity.</p>

<p>Grace found no joy in Ethel. Ethel hinted constantly
that her work in Gregg and Burley&#8217;s office
placed her in a class much above that of a salesgirl.
She had brought to perfection a kind of cloying sweetness
in her attitude toward the other members of the
family which Grace found hard to bear. Ethel was at
pains to remind her father from time to time that it
was due to his lack of foresight and initiative that she
had been obliged to become a wage-earner. Her remarks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
expressed something of the solicitude a mother
might manifest toward a slightly deficient child. The
effect of this upon Grace was to deepen her affection
and sympathy for her father. Several times she persuaded
him to go down town with her to a big motion
picture house where there was good music. He enjoyed
the pictures, laughing heartily at the comics;
and laughter had been the rarest of luxuries in Stephen
Durland&#8217;s life. Mrs. Durland refused to accompany
them; all the pictures she had ever seen had been vulgar
and she was on a committee of the State Federation
to go before the legislature and demand a more
rigid censorship.</p>

<p>Grace&#8217;s announcement that, on evenings when she
went to the French class she had entered with Irene,
she would stay down town for supper did not pass
unchallenged at the supper table, which she had begun
to dread for its cheerlessness and the opportunity
it afforded her mother and sister to express their dire
forebodings as to the future of the human race. One
evening after listening to a reiteration of their predictions
of calamity Grace broke the silence in which
she usually listened to these discussions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where you get these ideas, Ethel.
You must be unfortunate in your acquaintances if
you&#8217;re talking from your own knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland rallied at once to Ethel&#8217;s support.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Grace, you know Ethel is older and views
everything much more soberly than you do. You
know she&#8217;s in touch with all these agencies that are
trying to protect the young from the evils of a growing
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what evils?&#8221; Grace demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some things,&#8221; said Ethel impressively,
&#8220;that it&#8217;s better not to talk about.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s always the way!&#8221; Grace flared. &#8220;You&#8217;re
always insinuating that the world&#8217;s going to the devil
but you never say just how. I know perfectly well
what you&#8217;re driving at. You think because I work
in a department store I can&#8217;t be as good as you are!
I&#8217;ll tell you right now that the girls I know in Shipley&#8217;s
are just as good as any girls in town&mdash;perfectly splendid
hard-working girls. And one other thing I can
tell you, they don&#8217;t spend their time sneering at everybody
else. I&#8217;d rather be the worst sinner in creation
than so pure I couldn&#8217;t see a little good in other
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Grace!&#8221; Mrs. Durland pleaded. &#8220;You&#8217;re
unreasonable. No one was saying anything about
you or any other girl in Shipley&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ethel doesn&#8217;t have to say it straight out! I&#8217;m
not so stupid! Every time she takes that sanctified
air she&#8217;s preaching at me. I don&#8217;t pretend to be an
angel but I&#8217;m tired of hearing how wicked everybody
is. I don&#8217;t dare ask any of the girls I work with to
the house; you think they&#8217;re all rotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re all bad, and I&#8217;ve never said
such a thing,&#8221; Ethel declared, &#8220;But I <i>have</i> said that
Irene Kirby is not the type of girl I&#8217;d deliberately
choose to be my sister&#8217;s most intimate friend, and
I say it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Ethel, you girls mustn&#8217;t hurt each other&#8217;s
feelings! If you must quarrel please don&#8217;t do it before
your father and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This consideration for her father&#8217;s feelings was so
unusual that Grace laughed. Durland had been twisting
uneasily in his chair. His sympathies were wholly
with Grace. Ethel&#8217;s indirect method of criticizing her
younger sister enraged him, and in this particular instance
he was secretly pleased that Grace was striking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
back. He glanced about the table, cleared his
throat and asked in his mild tone for a second cup
of coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know Irene Kirby,&#8221; said Ethel, &#8220;but I
have heard some things about her I hate to hear about
<i>any</i> girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such as what? Tell me just what you&#8217;ve heard,&#8221;
said Grace, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you <i>insist</i>,&#8221; replied Ethel, with affected
reluctance, &#8220;she&#8217;s keeping company with a married
man. It&#8217;s been going on for some time. They were
seen together last Sunday night, quite late, driving
into town. Suppose you ask Irene where she was
last Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the man&#8217;s name?&#8221; Grace demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I needn&#8217;t mention his name! You ask Irene
to tell you. A girl friend of mine who used to work
in his office saw them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a word of it,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;You or
I or any other girl might be seen driving with a married
man without there being anything wicked about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you asked me and I told you,&#8221; returned
Ethel complacently. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a new story. I knew it
when I tried to persuade you not to go into Shipley&#8217;s,
but I thought I wouldn&#8217;t tell you why I thought it
best for you to keep away from Irene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene has been fine to me,&#8221; said Grace quickly;
&#8220;she&#8217;s one of the nicest and one of the most intelligent
girls I ever knew. I think it poor business
for a girl like you, who pretends to be a Christian, to
listen to scandalous stories about some one you hardly
know. I&#8217;ll say for Irene that I never heard her speak
an unkind word of any one. Every day she does a
lot of little kindnesses for people and she doesn&#8217;t
strut around about it either.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t question that you believe all that, Grace,&#8221;
remarked Mrs. Durland as she served the rice pudding
that was the regular dessert for Thursday evening.
&#8220;But you know Ethel is very careful what
she says about <i>every</i> one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve noticed that,&#8221; said Grace coldly.</p>

<p>Durland had eaten his pudding and was stolidly
slipping his napkin into its ring. The better course
might be to follow his example. Silence, Grace reflected,
offered the surest refuge from family bickering.
She saw the years stretching on endlessly, with
her work-day followed by evenings of discord in the
cheerless home circle. The prospect was not heartening.
It was two against two, and her father was only
passively an ally. When Roy came home he would
be pretty sure to align himself with his mother and
Ethel, in keeping with his general policy of taking
the easier and more comfortable way in everything.
It flashed through her mind that she might leave
home and take a room somewhere or join with two
or three girls and rent an apartment. But her parents
needed her help. She knew that her father was wholly
unlikely to assist materially with the household expenses.
Ethel had not demurred when she volunteered
to contribute in ratio to her earnings, which made
her share at least a third more each week than Ethel&#8217;s.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Ethel&#8217;s intimations that Irene Kirby was not as
good as she ought to be so exasperated Grace that in
a spirit of contrariness she hoped they were true. At
least she didn&#8217;t care whether they were true or not.
She knew little of Irene&#8217;s family but the bitterness
engendered by her own home life made it seem a
natural and pardonable thing for a girl who worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
hard and was obliged to live in an atmosphere of
perpetual criticism to take her pleasure where she
pleased. Her curiosity as to Irene&#8217;s social contacts
was greatly aroused. Irene, outwardly at least the
most circumspect of young women, certainly had mastered
the art of keeping her private affairs to herself.
Now and then she spoke of having gone to the
theatre or to a dance with some young man whose
name she always mentioned; but when Grace tried to
tease her about her suitors Irene dismissed them disdainfully.
They were impossible, she said, in her
large manner&mdash;bank clerks, traveling salesmen or
young fellows just starting in small businesses. She
wasn&#8217;t at all interested in marrying a young man with
his way to make, cooking for him in the kitchenette
of a four-room apartment, with a movie once a week
as the reward for faithful service.</p>

<p>These views on matrimony were revealed one day
early in November when they were lunching together
in Shipley&#8217;s tea room. She went on to say that she
would wait a few years in the hope of meeting some
man of importance who could give her a position in
life worth while.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been done before, my dear. It may not
sound romantic but it&#8217;s the only way to play safe. I
want to get away from this town! It smothers and
chokes me. The firm has sent me to New York twice
this last year, and I think I could get along very well
down there if I had money to spend. I&#8217;ve been a
little afraid you&#8217;d engaged yourself to some struggling
young professor at the university. No? Well,
I&#8217;d hate to see you wasting yourself. You&#8217;ve got
brains and good looks and I hope you won&#8217;t throw
yourself away. By the way&mdash;just what do you do
with yourself evenings?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;Oh, I stay at home, mostly. I do a turn in the
kitchen, play a game of checkers with father and go
to bed to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wholesome but not exciting! I&#8217;d imagined you
had a few suitors who dropped in occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t had a caller since I came home,&#8221; said
Grace. &#8220;The beaux I had last summer don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m
home and I haven&#8217;t felt like stirring them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene was wearing a handsome emerald ring that
Grace had not noticed before. In keeping with the
tone of subdued elegance she affected, Irene never
wore jewelry; the ring was a departure and required
an explanation for which Grace hesitated to ask. In
spite of their long acquaintance Grace never overcame
her feeling of humility before Irene&#8217;s large view of
things, her lofty disdain for small change. Grace
knew more out of books than Irene; but in her
cogitations she realized that beyond question Irene
knew much more of life. Aware of Grace&#8217;s frequent
glances at the emerald, Irene held up her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather pretty, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked carelessly.
&#8220;That cost some real money. A little gift from a
man who is foolish enough to admire me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly beautiful,&#8221; said Grace as Irene
spread her fingers on the table. &#8220;It&#8217;s the very newest
setting and a wonderful stone. I don&#8217;t believe I ever
saw you wear a ring before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve worn in years; but this is too
good to hide.&#8221; She looked at the stone absently. &#8220;By
the way, Grace, you don&#8217;t seem to be burdened with
engagements. I wonder if you&#8217;d care to drive into
the country tomorrow evening for dinner&mdash;a little
party of four. My friend&mdash;the man who gave me
this,&#8221;&mdash;she held up her hand,&mdash;&#8220;has a guest, a most
interesting man you&#8217;d be sure to like. If you haven&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
anything better to do it might amuse you to meet
him. A party of three is a little awkward and you&#8217;d
balance things beautifully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace&#8217;s heart quickened to find herself at last admitted
to Irene&#8217;s confidence, a thing flattering in itself.
Ethel&#8217;s charge that Irene was accepting the attentions
of a married man was probably true, or the girl would
have approached the matter differently. It dawned
upon Grace that the word party had a meaning
previously unknown to her, signifying a social event
clandestine in character, in which the wives of married
men were not participants. The idea was novel and
it caused Grace&#8217;s wits to range over a wide field of
speculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose men do sometimes take their wives on
parties that are a little different&mdash;just a quiet little
kick-up?&#8221; she ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so you&#8217;d exactly notice it,&#8221; Irene answered,
with a shrug and a smile of indulgence at Grace&#8217;s
innocence. &#8220;A wife knows her husband and all his
jokes; why should she meet him socially?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow night&#8217;s our French class,&#8221; said Grace,
recovering herself quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;d have to cut it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hadn&#8217;t forgotten that. To be frank about it,
I thought that would make it easier for you to get
away. I don&#8217;t know just how your folks at home
are&mdash;whether they always check you up as to where
you go. As you&#8217;ve been staying down town on lesson
nights that would help you put it over. I suggested
Friday night to my friend instead of Saturday, hoping
to make sure of you. There are plenty of girls who&#8217;ll
go on parties but this is a case where just any girl
won&#8217;t do. You&#8217;ll fit in perfectly and I hope you&#8217;ll
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, ever so much, Irene; of course, I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
pleased to death to go,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;But, you&#8217;ll
have to tell me what to wear; my wardrobe&#8217;s rather
limited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the occasion doesn&#8217;t call for magnificence.
Dinner&#8217;s to be in a charming old house about fourteen
miles from town. I&#8217;m going to wear the simplest
thing I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully nice of you to ask me,&#8221; said Grace,
her eyes dancing at the prospect. &#8220;But if I mustn&#8217;t
mention the party at home, I&#8217;ll have to get in early so
mother and Ethel won&#8217;t suspect anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them suspect, honey! My family used to try
to check me up every time I went to the corner to
mail a postal; but they&#8217;ve got over it. By the way,
I think that sister of yours doesn&#8217;t like me. I passed
her in the street yesterday and she gave me what I
shouldn&#8217;t call a loving look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;It&#8217;s just
that Ethel takes herself a little bit too seriously. She
has all the old-fashioned ideas about things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got the uplift idea and all that sort of stuff.
I met her in the office one day looking up a girl who
had dropped out of her church club or something.
That&#8217;s all fine work; I&#8217;m not sneering at it; but people
who go in for that kind of thing ought to remember
we&#8217;re not all born with wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ethel means well,&#8221; said Grace, her mind upon
the proposed dinner for four in the country, of which
she was anxious to hear more. &#8220;What time do we
start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven o&#8217;clock. You may be sure I trust you or I
shouldn&#8217;t be asking you to go on this party,&#8221; said
Irene. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a social event for the society columns&mdash;just
an intimate little dinner to be forgotten
when we all say good-night. Our host is Mr. Kemp&mdash;Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Ripley Kemp. You&#8217;ve seen his factory;
it&#8217;s as big as all outdoors. Don&#8217;t look so scared!
Tommy&#8217;s a peach! You can&#8217;t fail to like Tommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kemp is&mdash;married?&#8221; Grace ventured a little
timorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tommy&#8217;s been married for centuries! His
wife&#8217;s one of Shipley&#8217;s best customers. She&#8217;s awfully
nice; I tell Tommy he ought to be ashamed of himself!
Tommy&#8217;s not stingy with his family, and he&#8217;s
terribly proud of them. He has a daughter in an
Eastern college&mdash;a stunning girl. Elaine is just about
my age,&mdash;isn&#8217;t it weird!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I never saw Mr. Kemp, but of course I&#8217;ve
heard of him,&#8221; remarked Grace, bewildered by the
familiar tone in which Irene spoke of Kemp and his
family. &#8220;The other man&mdash;what&#8217;s he like?&#8221; she asked
with feigned carelessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, his name&#8217;s Ward Trenton and he lives in Pittsburgh
and is a consulting engineer and a way-upper all
right. Tommy thinks the sun rises and sets in Ward.
Ward drops in here every month or two and Tommy
always throws him a party, sometimes at home or at
one of the clubs; and when that&#8217;s the ticket he
naturally forgets to invite me! Screaming, isn&#8217;t it?
Ward isn&#8217;t really a sport like Tommy, but he&#8217;ll go on
a party and keep amused in his own peculiar way.
He does a lot of thinking, that man. You&#8217;ll understand
when you meet him. I&#8217;m never sure whether
Ward approves of me, but he&#8217;s always nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may not like me at all,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish! You&#8217;re just the kind of girl men
of that sort like. They&#8217;re bored to death by girls&mdash;you
know the kind&mdash;who begin every sentence with
&#8216;say&#8217; or &#8216;listen,&#8217; and would drop dead if they ever had
an idea. Tommy&#8217;s the higher type of business man,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Irene went on. &#8220;College education, fond of music and
pictures and that sort of thing. By the way, Tommy
has no particular love for that Cummings your father
was in business with so long. Make the same line of
stuff, don&#8217;t they? The Cummingses are going strong
since they moved up among the swells and it annoys
Tommy a good deal. You know his folks landed here
in 1820 and he&#8217;s full of old family pride. He&#8217;s perfectly
screaming about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Trenton&mdash;&#8221; Grace ventured, &#8220;is he married
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the nice men are more or less married, my
dear! Ward is and he isn&#8217;t. Tommy&#8217;s never seen
Mrs. Trenton, but there is such a person. Ward
speaks of his wife in the friendliest sort of way, but
they don&#8217;t meet often, I imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Grace recurred to the matter of changing
her clothes for the party, Irene&#8217;s resourcefulness
promptly asserted itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a very chic suit in stock, marked down
from eighty-seven to forty-two on account of an imperfection
in the embroidery on the cuffs. It will do
wonderfully and if you haven&#8217;t the money handy I&#8217;ll
take care of it till you strike a fat week. We&#8217;ll try it
on you this afternoon and if you like it we&#8217;ll send it up
to Minnie Lawton&#8217;s apartment and you can change
there. I&#8217;ll be doing the same&mdash;fact is, I keep a few
duds at Minnie&#8217;s for just such emergencies. Minnie&#8217;s
a good scout and attends strictly to her own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Minnie Lawton Irene referred to held a responsible
position with a jobbing house. Grace had
met her at lunch with Irene several times and had
found her a diverting person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minnie&#8217;s a broad-minded woman,&#8221; Irene remarked.
&#8220;I usually meet Tommy at Minnie&#8217;s when we&#8217;re going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
on a party, and that&#8217;s the schedule for tomorrow
evening. I&#8217;ll call Tommy now and tell him everything&#8217;s
set.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suit proved to be all that Irene had promised.
Grace was not unaware that the attendants were observing
her with frankly approving eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly sets you off, Eighteen. That shade of
Oriental blue is just right for you,&#8221; said one girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;An inch off the sleeve will help; the collar pinches
the least bit&mdash;or does it?&#8221; remarked Irene to the
hovering fitter. &#8220;All right then; thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace asked for an extra hour at noon the next day
for a hair-washing, marcelling and manicuring, saying
to Miss Boardman that she had an engagement with
the dentist. Irene had suggested this, explaining that
it wasn&#8217;t lying as all the girls gave the same reason
when asking extra time for any purpose, and Miss
Boardman wasn&#8217;t deceived by it.</p>

<p>Beyond a few experiments in her youth for which
she was promptly punished, Grace had rarely resorted
to deception; but manifestly she would be obliged to
harden herself to the practice if she yielded to the
temptation to broaden her experiences beyond the
knowledge of the home circle. She tried to think of
all the calamities that might befall her. Her father
or mother might become ill suddenly; an attempt
might be made to reach her at the rooms of the French
instructor; but instead of being dismayed by the possibility
Grace decided that it would be easy enough to
explain that she had gone unexpectedly to the house
of some friends of Irene who lived in the country.
She was sure she could make a plausible story of this;
and besides, if any one became so ill as to cause search
to be made for her the fact that she hadn&#8217;t gone to
the French lesson would be overlooked. There might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
be an automobile accident; the thought was disturbing
but it troubled Grace only passingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon learn to be ready with an <i>alibi</i> if you
get caught,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;But the more independence
you show the less you&#8217;ll be bothered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lively expectations of a novel experience that promised
amusement outweighed Grace&#8217;s scruples before
the closing hour of the appointed day. She and Irene
left the store together and found a taxi to carry them
to Minnie Lawton&#8217;s apartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll escape the trolley crowd,&#8221; said Irene placidly,
&#8220;and save time. Minnie&#8217;s not going home for supper
but I&#8217;ve got a key to her flat and we&#8217;ll have the
place to ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were dressed and waiting when Kemp and
his friend Trenton arrived. Assailed at the last
moment by misgivings as to the whole adventure,
Grace was relieved by her first glimpse of the two
men. Kemp was less than her own height, of slender
build and with white hair that belied the youthful color
in his cheeks. The gray in his neatly trimmed
mustache was almost imperceptible. Grace had pictured
him of a size commensurate with his importance
as the head of one of the largest industries in the
city, but he was almost ridiculously small and didn&#8217;t
even remotely suggest the big masterful type she had
imagined. His face lighted pleasantly as Irene introduced
him. His power was denoted in his firm
mouth and more particularly in his clear steady hazel
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so nice that you could come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
known of your family a long time, of course, and
Irene brags about you a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>In marked contrast to Kemp, Trenton was tall and
of athletic build, with gray-blue eyes, and a smile that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
came a little slowly and had in it something wistful
and baffling that piqued curiosity and invited a
second glance. Grace appraised his age at about forty.
She instantly decided that she preferred him to Kemp;
he was less finished with nothing of Kemp&#8217;s dapperness.
His careless way of thrusting his hands into the
pockets of his coat pleased her; he was not thinking
of himself, not concerned as to the impression he
made; slightly bored perhaps by the whole proceeding.</p>

<p>Trenton had greeted Irene cordially as an old
acquaintance and it was evident that the three had
met at other parties.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m starving,&#8221; said Irene; &#8220;let&#8217;s be moving,
Tommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Kemp. &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to feel
a pang myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A chauffeur opened the door of a big limousine that
was waiting at the curb. They were quickly speeding
countryward with Irene and Grace on the back seat
with Trenton between them. Kemp, on one of the adjustable
chairs, crossed his legs with the easy nonchalance
characteristic of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s business, Irene?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Are the dollars
rolling into the Shipley till?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My department is running ahead of last year&#8217;s
business,&#8221; said Irene, &#8220;but there&#8217;s less call for the
best grades.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So? Same reports all over the country. We must
charge it up to the war. Well, we can&#8217;t change business
conditions tonight. We&#8217;ll all die bankrupt if
things don&#8217;t take a brace and we may as well eat and
be merry while we can. Am I right, Ward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certain, Tommy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t always agree with me!&#8221; cried Kemp with
feigned asperity. &#8220;You have a most disagreeable way
of pretending to agree with me when you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too good a client for me to quarrel with.
And besides you&#8217;re always right, Tommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do stop spoiling him!&#8221; cried Irene. &#8220;Everybody
spoils Tommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you!&#8221; returned Kemp. &#8220;Your business in
life seems to be to keep me humble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t show on you! You don&#8217;t see any signs
of it, do you, Ward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s aging fast,&#8221; replied Trenton. &#8220;He&#8217;s
breaking down under the weight of his own humility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Find the man who&#8217;s giving the party! It&#8217;s going
to be a beautiful evening for me. Just one knock
after another! Grace, don&#8217;t let these birds prejudice
you against me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp addressed her by her first name quite as
though they were old acquaintances. They were skimming
rapidly over the Meridian street bridge and her
diffidence began to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be your friend, Mr. Kemp,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t mind what the others say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be all right; he needs friends; but don&#8217;t
mister him. He&#8217;s Tommy to one and all.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;O it&#8217;s Tommy this, an&#8217; Tommy that, an&#8217; &#8220;Tommy, go away&#8221;;</div>
<div class="verse">But it&#8217;s &#8220;Thank you, Mister Atkins,&#8221; when the band begins to play&#8217;,&#8221;&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Kemp quoted. &#8220;It&#8217;s the same old story!&#8221; he finished
in mock dejection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of music, did you bring some new
records, Tommy?&#8221; Irene inquired. &#8220;The ones you
have at the farm date from Rameses.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Yes; there&#8217;s a package of &#8217;em up in front, the very
latest jazz, and a few classic pieces for my own private
consolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like him,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;Tommy thinks
no one appreciates good music but himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp and Irene continued to do most of the talking,
occasionally appealing to Grace or Trenton to
support them in their good-natured contentions. For
a time Kemp and Trenton discussed business as
frankly as though they were alone. Grace began to
understand what Irene meant when she spoke of
knowing men of attainment and enjoying their confidence.
Kemp was saying that he was prepared to
enlarge his plant the moment business took an upward
turn. He meant to strike out more boldly into
the South American markets than he had ever done
before. His competitors didn&#8217;t know it, and he didn&#8217;t
want them to know it, but he already had men down
there preparing for an aggressive campaign. His tone
was optimistic and confident. It was evident that he
paid great deference to Trenton&#8217;s opinions and was
anxious for his approval of his plans. Once after
Trenton had answered at length and with the care
that seemed to be habitual with him a technical question
as to the production by a new method of castings
of a certain kind, Kemp turned and remarked to the
young women:</p>

<p>&#8220;That answer&#8217;s worth money! It&#8217;s a joy to talk to
a man who knows his stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even I could understand it!&#8221; said Grace, &#8220;or I
thought I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father sometimes had explained to her problems
in mechanics and Trenton had employed terms with
which she was familiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather expect you to know something about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
such things, Grace,&#8221; said Kemp. &#8220;Your father was
a pioneer in certain fields. Stephen Durland, you
know, Ward,&mdash;used to be in the Cummings concern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the name of course. I&#8217;ve run across it
frequently in the patent office reports. Your father&#8217;s
been a prolific inventor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he&#8217;s always inventing something, but I&#8217;m
afraid many of his things don&#8217;t work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true of hundreds,&#8221; said Kemp, &#8220;but certain
of Stephen Durland&#8217;s inventions are still standard.
I know because I&#8217;ve tried to cut under &#8217;em with things
of my own! It was a scoundrelly trick for Cummings
to put him out of the company&mdash;that&#8217;s what I understand
happened. You know I believe every mean
thing I hear about Cummings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose it was strictly a business matter,&#8221;
said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beastly ingratitude, I&#8217;d call it,&#8221; exclaimed Kemp.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been told that your father waived all rights to
royalty on all the patents he put into the company and
Cummings only gave him a fifth of the stock in the
original corporation to cover everything. Do pardon
me! But that whole business made me hot when I
heard about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was pretty hard to bear,&#8221; Grace murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no angel,&#8221; said Kemp, &#8220;but in the long run I
think we get it in the neck if we don&#8217;t play the game
straight. Cummings is riding for a fall. It tickles me
to see two or three places right now where he&#8217;s likely
to come a cropper. His narrowness and lack of vision
are going to have the usual result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you, the great Kemp, are going to push right
ahead!&#8221; laughed Trenton, laying his hand on his
friend&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing can keep Tommy down,&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Irene in mock admiration. &#8220;Tommy&#8217;s brain isn&#8217;t
just cottage cheese.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp enjoyed their chaffing and encouraged it.
They were still discussing Grace&#8217;s suggestion that
Mars and other planets might become littered with
Kemp machinery as new markets were sought for it
when they reached the farm.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>A winding road led from the highway through a strip
of woodland that bore upward to a ridge where the
lights of the house suddenly burst upon them. The
river, Kemp explained, lay just below.</p>

<p>A Japanese boy in white duck flung open the door
and smilingly bowed them in.</p>

<p>Kemp called his place The Shack, but in reality
it was a dignified old homestead that had been enlarged
and only slightly modernized. The parlor and
sitting room of the old part had been thrown into one
room with the broad fireplace preserved. The floors
were painted and covered with rag rugs; the furniture
was of a type that graced the homes of well-to-do
Middle Westerners in about the period of the
Mexican war. The rooms were lighted by a variety
of glass table-lamps with frosted shades adorned with
crystal pendants. These survivals of the days of
&#8220;coal-oil&#8221; lighting were now cleverly arranged to conceal
the electrical source of their illumination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a peach of a house?&#8221; demanded Irene as
she convoyed Grace through the lower rooms with a
careless air of proprietorship. She led the way up
the steep stairway, that had been retained as built by
the original owner, to the rooms above. The extensions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
following strictly the original simple architecture,
made a commodious place of the house, which
rambled on in an inadvertent fashion bewildering to
a first visitor. A wing that had been added in recent
years was hardly distinguishable from the old rooms.
Concessions to modern convenience and comfort had
been made in the sleeping rooms, of which there were
half a dozen, with white woodwork, walls in neutral
tints, and wicker furniture in summer cottage style.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all perfectly adorable,&#8221; cried Grace as they
paused in one of the rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to hand it to Tommy,&#8221; remarked Irene;
&#8220;he does have taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe&mdash;&#8221; Grace hesitated and Irene instantly
read her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re looking for the traces of a woman&#8217;s
hand! Bless your heart, Mrs. Kemp doesn&#8217;t bother
about The Shack! It was Tommy&#8217;s idea. The family
come out for week ends in the spring and fall and
Tommy makes a point of having Thanksgiving and
Christmas dinners out here, and Mrs. Kemp invites
the guests. I need hardly say&#8221;&mdash;Irene walked to a
chiffonier and inspected her face intently in the mirror&mdash;&#8220;that
I&#8217;ve never been invited to these <i>en famille</i>
functions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems queer,&#8221; remarked Grace, dropping her
hat on the bed,&mdash;&#8220;I mean it&#8217;s queer our being here
when <i>she</i> doesn&#8217;t know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Irene, surveying herself slowly
before the glass. &#8220;She&#8217;d probably like us if she knew
us, and didn&#8217;t know we work for a living. If Tommy
just has to play a little isn&#8217;t it fine that he chooses nice
little playmates like us? He might do much worse,
and get into awful scrapes. You needn&#8217;t be afraid
that the lady of the house will come tearing in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
make a fuss. Tommy never takes a chance. Her
ladyship&#8217;s in New York spending a lot of money and
having a grand old time. For all we know she&#8217;s playing
around a little bit herself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it wasn&#8217;t that I was thinking of so much,&#8221;
Grace replied hastily. &#8220;I was just thinking that it&#8217;s
like a play, this quaint interesting house hidden away,
with all these lovely things, and kind of funny to think
that there is a woman somewhere who belongs here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While we&#8217;re here <i>we</i> belong, my dear. We&#8217;ll pretend
it&#8217;s all ours. My conscience had awful twinges
the first time I came out; but one does somehow get
used to things. There&#8217;s no use bucking the spirit of
the age; we&#8217;ve got to step to the music of the band.
Tommy prefers a party of four and nearly always
brings an out-of-town man, so I have to find the other
girl. If you like this party I&#8217;ll put you on for some
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She swung around and eyed Grace critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just right! Tommy whispered to me in
the car that you were wonderful,&mdash;the first thing you
know he&#8217;ll be flirting with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so foolish! Any one can see that he&#8217;s
crazy about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that kind of insanity doesn&#8217;t last. These
little affairs are good for a while, but something always
happens sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with cheerful indifference as though it
were the inevitable ordering of fate that such affairs
should be brief.</p>

<p>At the table, with candles diffusing a yellow glow
upon the silver and crystal the party struck at once
a key of gaiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of the cocktail, Grace,&#8221; said Kemp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
lifting his glass; &#8220;only a little orange juice and a very
good gin I planted out here in the woods before prohibition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When all the rest of the world is dry Tommy will
still have a few bottles put away,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;There&#8217;s
going to be champagne, too! Here&#8217;s to you, Tommy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace sipped the cocktail warily, drank a third of it
and put it down with a covert glance at the others to
see whether they were watching her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all entitled to a dividend,&#8221; said Kemp. &#8220;Get
busy, Jerry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was fingering the stem of the cocktail glass,
meditating whether she should try it again, when Trenton
met her gaze. Irene and Kemp were talking
animatedly, quite indifferent to the other members of
the party.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really don&#8217;t want that,&#8221; Trenton said. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re not used to it let it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her glass, brimming from the dividend
Jerry had poured into it, and slowly drained it.</p>

<p>With a smile Grace quickly moved the glass back in
front of her plate, glancing at Irene and Kemp to see
whether they were observing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much. I really am not used
to those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought not; otherwise I should have let you
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s part of my business, to know things
without being told. You might say that I earn my
living that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed amused about something; he constantly
seemed secretly amused in a way of his own; but there
was no mistaking his wish to be kind, and Grace was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
grateful for his kindness. The light touch of his
fingers as he took the glass from her hand was in
itself reassuring.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re alone in the midst of a deep, dark forest,&#8221;
she heard Kemp exclaim.</p>

<p>Turning, she saw him bending toward Irene, his
arm round her shoulders, kissing her.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Irene and Kemp should embrace and kiss at
the table Grace assumed to be the accepted procedure
at such parties. Kissing to the accompaniment of
cocktails was not without its piquancy, but the picture
presented by Irene and Kemp she found unedifying.
Under the stimulus of alcohol Kemp and
Irene seemed to have thrown away the dignity with
which they had begun the party. Grace was not
without her experience of kissing, but her experiences
had been boy-and-girl transactions, all the sweeter for
their privacy. She wondered whether it might not be
necessary for Trenton to kiss her, but instead he rebuked
Kemp and Irene with mock severity for their
unbecoming conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two have no manners! We&#8217;re terribly embarrassed
on this side of the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do excuse us!&#8221; cried Kemp. &#8220;We were merely
carried away by our emotions. I just happened to remember
that I hadn&#8217;t kissed Irene for a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t pull that cave man stuff here,&#8221;
said Irene petulantly. She opened her vanity box
and squinted at herself in the tiny mirror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, everybody, while I powder my nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward&#8217;s never been kissed to my knowledge,
Grace,&#8221; said Kemp, apparently undisturbed by Irene&#8217;s
complaint of his roughness. &#8220;The field&#8217;s open to
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not going to begin in public,&#8221; said
Grace; &#8220;are we Ward?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>She turned smilingly toward Trenton, who met her
gaze quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;ve never been so tempted before,&#8221; he
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re bound to come to it!&#8221; cried Irene.
&#8220;Grace can&#8217;t pretend she&#8217;s never been kissed. She&#8217;s
just a little coy, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not coy!&#8221; Grace protested. &#8220;But I&#8217;m all out
of practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can easily fix that!&#8221; said Kemp, jumping
to his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kiss you right now. My
sense of hospitality demands it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much you&#8217;re not!&#8221; cried Irene, forcing him
back into his chair. &#8220;I see you kissing Grace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jealous!&#8221; cried Kemp, striking his hands together
with delight. &#8220;Jealous at last! But you needn&#8217;t be
scared Grace. There&#8217;s no fun kissing a girl against
her will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it would be against my will?&#8221;
Grace demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it would be against mine,&#8221; said Irene.
&#8220;Ward, why don&#8217;t you keep Grace interested? I&#8217;m
not going to have Tommy falling in love with her.
We&#8217;ve had some girls out here who played up to
Tommy and tried to take him away from me. That&#8217;s
why I brought Grace. She&#8217;s an old pal of mine and
my little boy&#8217;s not going to flirt with her, is you
Tommy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I isn&#8217;t!&#8221; Kemp answered and in proof
of his loyalty he kissed Irene again.</p>

<p>The food Jerry was serving called for praise and the
Japanese grinned his appreciation of the compliments
they bestowed upon his cooking. Kemp carved the
turkey; he always did his own carving; it gave the
home touch, he explained. Irene said she would make
the salad dressing and that would be another home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
touch. The essentials were placed before her and she
composed the dressing after a recipe Kemp had taught
her. It was the inspiration of Kemp&#8217;s pet waiter in a
New York club. Kemp talked for some time of
waiters he knew and their genius in the composition
of salads.</p>

<p>Grace had never before heard food discussed by
an epicure. It seemed odd that a busy man should
have given so much time and thought to the formulae
of the kitchen. Kemp appealed to Trenton for confirmation
of his appraisement of the merits of the
cooking they had enjoyed together in various parts of
the country, Trenton replying in a whimsical fashion,
tolerant of his friend&#8217;s enthusiasm, but letting it be
known that as for himself he was much less fastidious
about his food. Kemp paused in his neat, skilled carving
of the turkey to deliver a lecture on green turtle
soup. One might have thought that the whole progress
of civilization depended on settling then and there
exactly where green turtle soup attained perfection.
Kemp&#8217;s insistence that the New York Yacht Club was
entitled to highest honors in this particular brought
from Trenton the remark that he knew a place in
Kansas where the mock turtle was preferable to any
other liquid food he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heathen!&#8221; cried Kemp disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk of ham and eggs,&mdash;a brain food superior
to the much-boasted pie,&#8221; Trenton suggested. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a boarding house in a coal mining town in Southern
Colorado where a woman sets out the best ham and
eggs I ever ate. I ought to know; I ate &#8217;em three
times a day for two months!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an ostrich! If you don&#8217;t swear this is the
finest turkey you ever ate I&#8217;ll tell Jerry to serve you
ham and eggs and I&#8217;ll make you eat &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace eyed her champagne glass with the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
hesitancy with which she had regarded the cocktail.
She had never before seen champagne. From what
she had heard and read of it she knew it to be one of
the essentials of the new order of life into which she
was being initiated.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very last,&#8221; said Kemp, taking the bottle
from the cooler and holding it up for their admiration.
&#8220;Positively the last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same old joke!&#8221; exclaimed Irene. &#8220;Tommy&#8217;s got
enough liquor hid away out here to last forty years.
I&#8217;ve seen the cave he built to keep it in&mdash;there&#8217;s
oceans of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rotten exaggeration,&#8221; Kemp rejoined, thrusting
the bottle back into the cooler and taking up his glass.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t enough to last me twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene now engaged him in a lively debate as to the
merits of the wine. She pretended to a critical knowledge
of vintages and after demanding to see the label
expressed serious doubts as to the authenticity of the
contents.</p>

<p>Kemp challenged her assertions; apparently the
two found the greatest pleasure in taunting each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re off!&#8221; groaned Trenton; &#8220;you&#8217;d think they
hated each other from the way they talk. We&#8217;ll be
dignified, Grace, and keep out of their silly controversies.
Between ourselves, I&#8217;ve been exposed to a
great deal of champagne, but I can&#8217;t tell one brand
from another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s terribly dangerous, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Grace,
peering into her glass. &#8220;I took your advice about
the cocktail and I didn&#8217;t feel it at all; how much may
I drink of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, about a quarter of that won&#8217;t do you any
harm,&#8221; Trenton replied after pondering the matter
with exaggerated gravity. &#8220;It seems to me you&#8217;re rubbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
it in just a little by asking my opinion in that tone
of voice. One might think I was your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not nearly old enough for that! But
would you be ashamed of me,&#8221; Grace asked, sipping
the wine and holding up the glass each time that he
might see that she was not exceeding her allowance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of you even if you were
my aunt! I was just thinking how singular it is that
when a man reaches forty he wants every girl he meets
to think he&#8217;s only twenty-seven. Have you noticed
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I&#8217;ll remember it. I can see you&#8217;re terribly
wise. Have I had enough of this pretty stuff?&#8221;</p>

<p>He inspected her glass carefully and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I drank it all I might be more amusing,&#8221; she
suggested. &#8220;I might be as lively as Irene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me study you first without artificial stimulation.
As I have every intention of keeping sober myself
you&#8217;ll get some little idea of what manner of
being I am. A first meeting is important&mdash;it&#8217;s either
that or nothing. If we both got tipsy it would be
different; but frankly I don&#8217;t like being tipsy. Oh,
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve never been! Far, far from it. But
tonight I have a feeling that it wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate
for me to lose my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o?&#8221; she inquired, with all the mockery she
dared employ.</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a question from Kemp,
who was now discussing automobiles with Irene.
Kemp invited Trenton&#8217;s support in his defense of the
limousine in which they had driven to The Shack.
The car was not to Irene&#8217;s liking and she warned him
never to buy another of the same make. Kemp tried
to explain why he had not met her wishes in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
matter. The car was a product of his home town and
the manufacturer was a friend and it was his policy
to patronize local industries. Grace thought it
ridiculous that Irene should show so much feeling
about a matter which was, strictly speaking, none of
her concern. The car had seemed to Grace a machine
of much splendor and it had borne them speedily
and comfortably to the farm. She was unable to understand
why her friend was so earnestly denouncing
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them bother you,&#8221; said Trenton, &#8220;they
get into a row about cars every time I&#8217;m here. Their
ignorance is pitiful; neither one of them knows a
thing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t know anything about cars?&#8221; demanded
Irene testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I&#8217;ve wakened the enemy&#8217;s pickets,&#8221; laughed
Trenton. &#8220;You two ought to remember that just six
weeks ago tonight you threshed out the whole business.
You ought to know by this time, Irene, that
Tommy is as obstinate as a mule. He&#8217;d be sure to
buy the very car you warned him against.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew all the time that&#8217;s what he&#8217;d do. Of
course I don&#8217;t have to be satisfied. But I&#8217;d rather
ride in a jitney,&#8221; Irene rejoined scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowing your aristocratic taste I don&#8217;t see you,&#8221;
said Kemp, turning to the others. &#8220;We are not really
fussing today; it&#8217;s just a little sketch we&#8217;re putting on.
Irene and I never quarrel. I just lead her on for the
joy of seeing how ignorant she is about the things she
spouts about the loudest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The talk now shifted to the theatre, it appearing
that Kemp in his business trips to New York found
time to cultivate the acquaintance of many actors and
actresses. Irene had met some of them, both in New
York, where she seemed to have encountered Kemp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
on her buying excursions for Shipley&#8217;s, and at home,
where Kemp always &#8220;threw a party&#8221; for his particular
admirations among theatrical people when they
visited Indianapolis. Apparently these parties had
been very gay from the manner in which Irene and
Kemp referred to them. They recounted with particular
delight an occasion on which the star of a
musical comedy had with the greatest difficulty been
put into condition to resume his itinerary after a Saturday
night at The Shack. Irene was moved to immoderate
laughter at the recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he gets a bun he&#8217;s ever so much funnier off
the stage than he ever is on. He climbed out of a
window when we were trying to get him in shape to
go to his train and would you believe it!&mdash;we found
him in the barnyard talking to a pig! Then he cried
to take the little brown piggy with him; he said he
wanted it for his understudy. He was perfectly
screaming about that silly little pig, and we fooled
around so long he missed the last possible train and
Tommy had to drive him clear to Chicago for a Sunday
night opening. He kept saying every time we
told him he had missed another train that he would
wait till it came back! You couldn&#8217;t beat that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace and Trenton were laughing more at Irene&#8217;s
enjoyment of her own story than at the incident itself.
They learned that the comedian had finally been
landed at the stage door of the Chicago theatre where
he was to appear barely in time to dress for his part.
Kemp was enthusiastic about the drive, which had
broken all records. He interrupted Irene&#8217;s story with
many details of the flight which she had forgotten.</p>

<p>When Irene and Kemp again became absorbed in
each other Grace picked up the thread of her talk with
Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;We stopped just where it was growing interesting,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
she remarked. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go right on where we left off.
You were saying you thought it better not to lose your
head tonight. Was that on my account? Am I such
a young innocent that you&#8217;ve got to take care of
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed at the eagerness with which she flung
these sentences at him. If she was affected by her restricted
potations there was nothing in her manner or
speech to indicate the fact. Her eyes were bright,
but only from the excitement of her entrance upon
a new field of adventure. Once a young student at the
university had addressed some verses &#8220;To Her Questing
Eyes&#8221; and published them in one of the college
periodicals. The poem had been instantly recognized
as a tribute to Grace Durland; questing was a fitting
term for a certain look that came into her eyes at
times when her habitual eager gaze became crossed
oddly with a far-away look of revery. Trenton was
doing full justice to her eyes and was mindful of their
swift changes.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole I don&#8217;t really believe you need protecting,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;Oh, just a little, perhaps;
but I think I&#8217;d trust you to take care of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if I don&#8217;t want to be taken care of! What
if I want to jump into the water with a big splash!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um! So that&#8217;s the idea? Well, I think you&#8217;d
swim out; and yet again you mightn&#8217;t. There are
those who don&#8217;t,&#8221; he ended gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid&mdash;I&#8217;m not afraid of anything!&#8221; she
said with a defiant lifting of her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; He narrowed his eyes and looked at
her sharply. &#8220;Broadly speaking, it&#8217;s better not to be
afraid of life; life&#8217;s got to be lived.&#8221; He pecked at
his salad for a moment, then put down his fork and
went on. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to meet situations; play the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
game with the cards as they&#8217;re dealt. We hear a good
deal these days about our grand old grandfathers and
what heroic stuff they were made of. They fought
with savages who didn&#8217;t have the right ammunition
to fight back with; but nowadays the savages are inside
of us. The wild streak in man is showing itself.
It&#8217;s in all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He touched his breast lightly and smiled to minimize
the seriousness of what he was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right around here, where the corn grows tall, you
might think&mdash;and probably a lot of people back
yonder in the city like to think&mdash;that everything&#8217;s safe
and it&#8217;s easy to be good! We&#8217;re all being tested all
the time. The man who was an angel fifty years ago
would probably be a perfect devil these days if he had
half a chance. The world is a different place every
morning; but that&#8217;s only an old habit the world has.
It keeps spinning a little faster all the time. Now
we&#8217;ve got right here&mdash;&#8221; with a slight movement of the
head he indicated Kemp and Irene&mdash;&#8220;we&#8217;ve got a situation
that wouldn&#8217;t have been possible twenty years
ago&mdash;at least not in a town like this. But we may be
sure something of the kind was going on only it was
better hidden. Nowadays with more people and more
wealth and the general craving for excitement things
happen differently. We may regret such things, you
and I, but we are not helping matters by denying they
exist. Everybody is restless; people are living as
though they expected to die tomorrow and are afraid
they&#8217;re going to miss something; but I don&#8217;t believe
people are wickeder than they used to be. What we
used to call wicked we call naughty now, and pretend
it doesn&#8217;t matter!&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke half questioningly, as though not sure of
her assent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s so,&#8221; she replied soberly. &#8220;I never
thought of it in that way. But,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you
must have lots of other responsibilities&mdash;more important
ones, without troubling about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not much use in the world if we haven&#8217;t a
few. I think&mdash;I think I might put you on my list.
How would you like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be wonderful if you thought me worth
thinking about after we leave here!&#8221; she answered,
her eyes bright.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I never saw you again I shouldn&#8217;t forget you.
You&#8217;re a vivid person; I can honestly say that you&#8217;re
the most interesting person I&#8217;ve met in a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were interrupted by Irene and Kemp who
rose suddenly from the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy and I are going to dance,&#8221; said Irene.
&#8220;You two can have your coffee where you like. There&#8217;s
a cordial if you want it&mdash;Tommy has everything, you
know.&#8221; She rested her hand for a moment on Trenton&#8217;s
shoulder. Her face was flushed and her voice a
little strident. &#8220;You two are spooning beautifully.
You may be awfully proud of yourself, Grace. I never
saw Ward so interested in any girl before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run along, Irene; Grace and I are talking of
serious matters,&#8221; Trenton replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to that, Tommy! These idiots are serious!
It&#8217;ll never do to leave them here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp caught Trenton by the arm and dragged him
from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be serious &#8217;n my house, Ward Trenton! Always
too serious for Irene and me. Just look &#8217;t that
beautiful girl I got you to play with; silly to be serious
with a girl like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; we&#8217;ll dance then,&#8221; said Trenton,
amiably.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;Thass the talk! Don&#8217;t forget this&#8217;s a party, not
a funeral.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry had rolled back the rugs and pushed the
furniture out of the way in the living room. Kemp
and Irene were already on the floor dancing exaggeratedly
to the air of one of the new records.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not up to date on the new stuff,&#8221; remarked
Trenton apologetically; but Grace found that he
danced well and evidently with enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two not drinkin&#8217; enough,&#8221; said Kemp in
one of the pauses, planting himself waveringly before
Trenton and Grace and extending a glass. &#8220;Gotta
drink more; party&#8217;s no good without wine; lots o&#8217;
wine. Want everybody t&#8217; get soused like me.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Grace&#8217;s experience of drunkenness had been limited
to the occasional sight of a tipsy man in the street
and she was shocked by the unhappy change in
Kemp&#8217;s appearance. His suave courtesy had disappeared.
His hair was in disorder; Irene had rumpled
it before they left the table, saying that he was too
pretty; and as he talked his head moved queerly in
time with his jerky articulation. And he looked old;
one might have thought that Age, as a punishment
for his intemperance had snatched away his youthful
mask. Finding that Grace and Trenton paid no heed
to his demand that they drink more wine he followed
them over the floor and finally arrested them while he
apologized elaborately for neglecting Grace. She was
his guest and it was time that he was dancing with
her. Irene rose from the couch where she had been
watching them and announced her determination to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
teach Trenton a new step; his manner of dancing was
all out of date she said. She flung her arms around his
neck and with her head on his shoulder pushed him
about, while Kemp, delighted at Trenton&#8217;s discomfiture,
clapped his hands in time to the music.</p>

<p>Grace, finding herself free, seized the moment to
try to escape, but Kemp lunged to the door and intercepted
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Runnin&#8217; &#8217;way from me! Awfu&#8217; bad manners run
away from host. Gotta dance with me like Irene.
Thass right, Grace; good li&#8217;l&#8217; sport; Irene&#8217;s friends all
good sports.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her arms and clasped them about his
neck but as his muddled senses were unequal to responding
to the rhythm of the music the performance
resolved itself chiefly into an attempt on Grace&#8217;s part
to keep him on his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I stepped on you. Awfu&#8217; sorry, Grace.
Wouldn&#8217;t step on you for anything in this wide, wide
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was great fun!&#8221; Grace cried when the
record had played itself out. She was determined to
make the best of it, but Trenton, mopping his brow,
intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy, you&#8217;re too rough! Grace doesn&#8217;t want to
dance any more; we&#8217;re going to have our coffee. You
go and dance with Irene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor sport! Awfu&#8217; poor sport,&#8221; Kemp retorted
as Trenton led Grace away. He bawled after them
his conviction that they were both poor sports and
resumed dancing with Irene.</p>

<p>Jerry had placed the coffee-tray in a long, comfortably
furnished sun porch opening off the dining
room, where the music and the voices from the living
room penetrated only feebly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to like this better,&#8221; said Grace
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little calm <i>is</i> agreeable after a rough house,&#8221;
said Trenton watching her intently as she seated herself
by the table and filled the cups. &#8220;Tommy never
knows his limit,&#8221; he went on, taking a cigarette from
a silver box on the stand. &#8220;He can&#8217;t carry the stuff
as he used to and he doesn&#8217;t act pretty when he&#8217;s
shot. But he recovers quickly; he&#8217;ll be all right soon.
Irene knows how to manage him. One lump, thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was still breathing deeply from the violence
of her romp with Kemp. She was hoping that Trenton
would renew the talk she had been enjoying at the
table; but his silence was disconcerting. She wondered
whether he was not purposely waiting for her
to speak, to show her reaction to the scenes in which
they had been participating in the living room.</p>

<p>She turned to him presently with a slight smile on
her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see that I&#8217;m a terrible greenhorn. I
don&#8217;t know how to act at a party&mdash;not this kind of
a party. I suppose it isn&#8217;t nice of us to run away,
but you were an angel to come to the rescue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always pleasant to be called an angel!&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t happened to me for some time.
Tommy would die of chagrin if he knew he&#8217;d been
making a monkey of himself; but he&#8217;s likely to do
most anything when he gets a bun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry came in to inspect the wick of the coffee
lamp and Trenton detained him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Jerry, you needn&#8217;t serve any more drinks.
Mr. Kemp doesn&#8217;t need any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yezzah.&#8221; The boy bowed imperturbably and withdrew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;Jerry and I understand each other perfectly. He&#8217;ll
take care of that. I wonder what the boy thinks! But
you never can penetrate the innermost recesses of the
Oriental mind. He probably doesn&#8217;t approve of
Tommy&#8217;s parties, if we knew the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s used to them. Let me see, what
were we talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t settled anything; we were going round
in a circle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s keep revolving! I want to hear you
talk some more. I want to know your ideas about
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a large order,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
do my best!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was struck suddenly with a fear that he might
be finding her company irksome. It was quite likely
that at other times, when he had been provided with
a companion familiar with the technic of such parties,
he had contributed more to the gaiety of the occasions.
But her imagination was unequal to the task of
visualizing him in such antics as Kemp was engaged
in. He impressed her more and more as she studied
him as a man who kept himself in perfect control;
who found indeed a secret enjoyment in merely looking
on when others were bent upon making an exhibition
of themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were speaking awhile ago of our naughtiness in
accepting an invitation to a function like this. I&#8217;ve
attended a lot of such parties here and elsewhere. I
am always wondering why I&#8217;m invited and why I go.
Perhaps,&#8221; he smiled quizzically, &#8220;it&#8217;s to give moral
tone! That&#8217;s undoubtedly why you were invited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That excuse won&#8217;t do for me!&#8221; she replied quickly.
&#8220;I wanted to come; I was perfectly crazy to come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s just as well to satisfy your curiosity. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
assure you these parties are all alike. I&#8217;ve taken a
hand in them in every part of the world. The only
thing that makes this one different is&mdash;&#8221; he smiled
broadly and his eyes danced with humor&mdash;&#8220;is you! I
might say that you are quite different. You create
an atmosphere quite your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up and explain that!&#8221; She clasped her
hands in mock appeal. &#8220;I might be different and still
very unsatisfactory!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is that possibility,&#8221; he answered musingly.
&#8220;A girl requires a little practice to catch the
stroke. That is, she has got to get over the first shock
before she becomes a good party girl. You&#8217;re a novice.
It will be interesting to know just how you emerge
from the novitiate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you be interested in that,&mdash;really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vastly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her attention wavered and with a quick lifting of
the head she bent a startled questioning look upon
him. The new records of distinguished operatic stars
which Kemp and Irene had been playing had served
as a faint accompaniment to their talk, but the music
and the sound of voices were no longer audible in the
sun porch. Grace glanced nervously about, oppressed
by the silence. Voices and steps were heard in the
rooms above. Trenton asked if she had read a
novel which he took from the lower shelf of the
stand that held the coffee things. Her negative
reply was almost hostile and she did not meet
his gaze. Her face wore a look of cold detachment.
It seemed to him that the girl was no longer
there; that what he saw was merely a shadowy shape
that might pass utterly at any moment. He rose
and dropped his half-smoked cigarette into an ashtray
on the stand. When he faced her again the look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
had changed. He interpreted it as an appeal and he
was not unmindful of its poignancy. She sat erect,
her head lifted, her hands clasped upon her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just wondering&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tommy and Irene? They&#8217;re about somewhere,&#8221;
he said carelessly. He reached for a fresh
cigarette, eyed it as though it were an unfamiliar thing
and lighted it deliberately. That look in her face, the
appeal in her eyes, had struck deep into him. He sat
down beside her on the davenport, crossed his knees
and folded his arms. His composure restored her
confidence. In a moment she settled back, quite herself
again.</p>

<p>He touched rapidly upon a great number of problems,
talking well, with an animation that surprised
her. But she knew that he was trying to make her
forget her perturbation of a moment ago. It was an
enormous satisfaction to know that he understood; it
was almost uncanny that he understood so much of
what was in her mind and heart without being told.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t impudent for me to ask, I&#8217;d like to know
just what you&#8217;re aiming at,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You look like
a girl who might be cursed with ambitions. Can&#8217;t
you let me into the secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, honestly, I haven&#8217;t any! When I was at the
university I thought I had some&mdash;but they were silly.
Like every other girl I was crazy for a while to be
a trained nurse, then a settlement worker, and I even
thought I might be a writer, and for about a week
I had a craze to study medicine. Then I had to leave
college, so I took a job in a department store! How&#8217;s
that for ambition!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little mixed; but the books are not closed yet!
There&#8217;s plenty of time for fresh entries. There&#8217;s marriage.
You&#8217;ve overlooked that. That must be on
the program!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the first number! College girls who don&#8217;t
get married the day after commencement are likely
to wait awhile. I&#8217;m not a bit excited about getting
married. I want to look the world over before I settle
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you fell in love&mdash;some fine fellow who could
take good care of you. What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had chances to marry and I couldn&#8217;t see
it. I&#8217;ve never been in love&mdash;not really. There&#8217;s
a professor who wanted to marry me&mdash;a widower with
two children. You wouldn&#8217;t have me do that? And
young fellows, several of them, very nice, who caused
me a lot of bother before I got rid of them. I liked
them all but I couldn&#8217;t love them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll make the prediction that always applies
in such cases; some day you&#8217;ll meet just the right man
and that will be the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe; but I don&#8217;t see it now. All I want&mdash;all I
want right now is to be free!&#8221; she said and a far-away
look came into the dark eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;One can be free and terribly lonesome too,&#8221; he
suggested. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing quite so horrible as being
lonesome. This is a big world and just knocking
around by yourself isn&#8217;t much good. We all need
companionship; the soul cries for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him quickly, surprised at his sudden
seriousness and the note of depression in his voice.
In her great liking for him she groped for an explanation
of his change of mood. He had not struck
her as at all a moody person. Some reply seemed
necessary and she was at a loss to know what to say
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re a success!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;It&#8217;s only
when a man fails that he&#8217;s likely to be lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Success is a beautiful word, but to myself I&#8217;m a
decided failure. I&#8217;ve failed in the most important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
thing a man ever undertakes. Don&#8217;t look at me like
that! I&#8217;ll explain. I&#8217;m supposed to be a mechanical
expert, but there&#8217;s one mechanism that&#8217;s beyond me.
I&#8217;m referring to the heart of a woman. My ignorance
of that contrivance is complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim look that had come into his face yielded
to a smile as he saw her bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be bored in a minute! I didn&#8217;t
want you to think me more than twenty-seven and
you&#8217;re already guessing that I&#8217;m at least seventy and
a doddering wreck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking that at all. You seemed unhappy
and I was sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t be sorry for me. I&#8217;m not deserving
of any one&#8217;s pity&mdash;not even my own. When I spoke
of failure I was thinking of my marriage. Irene probably
told you I&#8217;m married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I asked her the first thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it made no difference to you&mdash;about coming
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I just thought of
it as an experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather like studying a bug under glass, is that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, something of the sort. But&mdash;you were speaking
of your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said with a smile; &#8220;my being married
is not a confidential matter; nothing to hide or be
ashamed of. My wife is a very charming woman.
You&#8217;d probably fall under her spell if you knew her;
people frequently do. And I think she&#8217;d probably
like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if she knew I had met you at a party like
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, that wouldn&#8217;t make a particle of difference
in her liking you or not liking you! She&#8217;s broad-minded&mdash;very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
much so! And it&#8217;s one of her many
good points that she isn&#8217;t jealous. If she came in here
and found me talking to you she wouldn&#8217;t scream
and break up the furniture; she&#8217;d join in the conversation
and make herself interesting&mdash;say startling
things just to make us sit up. After a fashion she&#8217;s a
philosopher, very much entertained by what the
world&#8217;s doing. She sees in me only one of the many
millions, a queer specimen for the microscope. She
actually puts me into the books she writes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace bent her head, lifted it quickly and exclaimed:
&#8220;Is she Mary Graham Trenton? I&#8217;ve read her &#8216;Clues
to a New Social Order&#8217; but I never imagined&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you wouldn&#8217;t connect me with anything so
daring! I need hardly repeat that she&#8217;s a broad-minded
woman. I&#8217;d be interested to know how you
come to know about that book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s easy enough. We had a lecture on it in
our sociology course at the university. The head
of the department didn&#8217;t approve of Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s
views and warned us against the book, so of course
I read it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s interesting; awfully interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Written, I assure you,&#8221; laughed Trenton, &#8220;by a
remarkable woman!&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The unhappy marriages of which Grace had known
had failed for obvious reasons, but Trenton&#8217;s case was
fascinating in its subtleties. He spoke of his wife
as a man might speak of a woman he admired in a
detached sort of way without really knowing her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
In spite of his amiable attitude toward Mrs. Trenton,
Grace found herself instantly his partisan; she was
sure his failure as he called it was his wife&#8217;s fault.
She greatly disliked this woman she had never seen.
She started and flushed when he said abruptly, almost
as though he had read her thoughts:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting ready to pity me&mdash;but don&#8217;t do
it! It&#8217;s something in me that&#8217;s wrong. We don&#8217;t
quarrel and throw dishes across the table or call each
other names. We respect each other tremendously.
It isn&#8217;t even one of these triangular affairs,&mdash;another
man or woman. When we meet now and then we
talk quite sanely and sensibly of the news of the
day and the arts and sciences, as two strangers
might talk in a smoking car. The trouble may lie
right there. A man and wife must be necessary to
each other to make a perfect marriage and we are not.
For seven or eight years we&#8217;ve mostly gone our separate
ways. She has her own interests, plenty of them.
If I tell her I&#8217;m going to Hong Kong to do a job and
ask her to go along she&#8217;ll say that she doesn&#8217;t think
it would amuse her. She&#8217;ll go to Paris and stay till
I come back. All cheerful, you understand; no row!
Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s quite able to do as she pleases,&mdash;as to
money, I mean,&mdash;independently of me. And she
knows people everywhere and they like to have her
around. I like having her around myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps one of these days everything will come
right,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s enough of me.
Let&#8217;s talk about you a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew her out as to her experiences at the university
but when these were exhausted he told her something
of his own history. He had been thrown upon
the world at an early age, and, not without difficulty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
had worked his way through a technical school. His
profession had carried him to every part of the world.
He told amusing stories of the reaction of remote
foreign peoples to the magic of modern machinery.
No other man had ever interested Grace half so much.
Trenton was like a pilgrim from another and larger
world; she was fascinated by the cosmopolitan fashion
in which he changed the scene of his adventures from
China to South Africa and from South America to
far-flung islands whose very names were touched with
the glamour of romance. Some of his journeys had
been merely pleasure excursions; he got restless sometimes,
he said, and had to go somewhere; but chiefly
he had traveled to sell or to install machinery, or to
work out mechanical problems under new and difficult
conditions. There was no conceit in him&mdash;a vein of
self-mockery ran through most of his talk. He made
light of the perplexities and dangers he had encountered;
there was no fun, he said, in the performance
of easy tasks. He knew usually when he was employed
that his services were sought in the hope that he
might be able to solve riddles which other very capable
persons had given up.</p>

<p>Grace studied him at leisure through his desultory
monologue, interrupting only to ask questions to keep
him assured of her interest. Her mind turned back
repeatedly to what he had said of his wife. She was
quite sure that Mrs. Trenton didn&#8217;t appreciate her
husband&#8217;s fine qualities. He was a man of genius,
and as such probably wasn&#8217;t always easy to understand;
but it was Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s business, the girl reflected,
to learn to understand him, to seek ways of
making him happy. She was more and more struck
by his seeming indifference to most things, even to
is own achievements. Her imagination played upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
him with girlish romanticism. He ought to be aroused,
awakened; he deserved to be loved, to have the companionship
he craved. And yet from the manner in
which he spoke of his wife it was a serious question
whether he didn&#8217;t love her. Whether the unknown
woman loved him was another question that kept
thrusting itself into her thoughts.</p>

<p>As he rambled on through the hour they were alone
he played fitfully with the end of a gold locket which
he carried on his watch chain. He would draw this
from his right hand waistcoat pocket, seemingly unconscious
of what he was doing, and hold it in his hand
or smooth it caressingly. She speculated as to whether
it did not contain a picture of Mrs. Trenton; she even
considered asking him to let her see it.</p>

<p>Again steps and voices were heard above and Trenton
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s eleven o&#8217;clock and Tommy and I are taking
the midnight train for St. Louis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to beat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and stood beside him, sorry that the evening
was so nearly over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll always remember tonight; you&#8217;ve been awfully
nice to me!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t! If you begin thanking me I&#8217;ll know
you feel I&#8217;m older than the hills. I see it all now!
I made my story cover too many years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s not it at all!&#8221; she protested. &#8220;I was
just wondering how you ever crowded so much into
your young life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do that sort of thing very prettily! And when
you look at me like that you become dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m dangerous&mdash;not in the
least little bit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not to be caught in that trap! A wise man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
never acknowledges to a woman that she&#8217;s dangerous.
They ought to have taught you that at the university.
But you&#8217;re patient! You&#8217;ve listened to me as Desdemona
listened to Othello!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; she said daringly, tilting her head, &#8220;I
believe I&#8217;d like to flirt with you&mdash;oh, just a little bit!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a step nearer, his hands thrust into his
pockets in his characteristic way. He drew them out
and they fell to his side as he regarded her fixedly
with a smile on his lips. Then very gently he took her
cheeks between his hands. She thrilled at the touch.
They were fine strong hands; she had noted repeatedly
all through the evening how finely formed they were,
and the strength implied in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s meant very much to me to meet you&mdash;you
can&#8217;t know how much. I almost feel that I know you
a little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s meant so much more to me,&#8221; she returned
sincerely. &#8220;I&#8217;d be ashamed if I wasn&#8217;t grateful. And
that doesn&#8217;t mean at all that I feel that you&#8217;re a day
older than I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were smiling gravely into each other&#8217;s eyes.
There was not for the moment at least any question
of a disparity of years. She drew away slowly until
her face was free of his touch; then she laid her hands
lightly on his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please kiss me,&#8221; she whispered, and their lips met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you two!&#8221;</p>

<p>They swung around to find Kemp in the door, watch
in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just got time to make it. Your bag is at
the station, Ward? All right. Go up and get your
things, Grace. And tell Irene to hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp was again the man of business, his preoccupation
with the journey already showing in his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Irene was giving the last touches to her hair when
Grace found her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready in just a minute,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How did you
get on with good old Ward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s perfectly lovely! He&#8217;s the most interesting
man I ever met!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they all say. Have any luck vamping
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; replied Grace, putting on her hat.
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t expect me to make a hit with a man
like that. He&#8217;s too big and much too wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the wiser they are the harder they fall!&#8221; replied
Irene carelessly. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that he didn&#8217;t
leave you and go out for a walk all by his lonesome.
That&#8217;s the way he treated a girl I wished on him once.
Actually, my dear, walked out of the house and didn&#8217;t
come back till Tommy and I were ready to go! But
she got soused, the little fool. I guess I was lit up
for a little while tonight and Tommy certainly was
feeling his poison when Jerry put the wine away. He&#8217;s
all right now. It hits him quick and then it&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry appeared to bow them ceremoniously into the
car. On the way into town they talked only fitfully.
When the men spoke it was to discuss the business
that was calling them to St. Louis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Minnie Lawton&#8217;s for the night, Grace,&#8221;
said Irene. &#8220;You&#8217;d better stop there with me. It&#8217;s
easier doing that than explaining things at home.
There won&#8217;t be time for you to stop at Minnie&#8217;s to
change your things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace had considered the possible embarrassment
that might result from going home at midnight in the
new gown. She meant to explain that she had changed
before leaving the store and had gone home with Irene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
after the French lesson, and some of Irene&#8217;s friends
had dropped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take a chance of being scolded,&#8221; remarked
Kemp. &#8220;You know your family and I suppose you
have some leeway. I&#8217;d hate for you to get into trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll fix everything all right. It isn&#8217;t so awfully
late. I&#8217;ll be home by twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>They dropped Irene at Minnie&#8217;s and then swung
westward. Grace indicated a point a block from home
where they might leave her.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you like The Shack I hope you&#8217;ll come again,&#8221;
said Kemp. &#8220;It&#8217;s been fine to have you along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll meet again,&#8221; said Trenton. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t settle
much! There&#8217;ll have to be some more talks&mdash;many
of them I hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so too! Thank you both ever so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she reached the Durland gate she caught a
last glimpse of the tail light as the car swung southward
round the park.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> turned off the hall light at the switch at the
head of the stairs and gained her room unchallenged.
Usually her mother waited up for her, and Grace
breathed a sigh of relief to find her door closed. She
quickly undressed, hiding the new suit in the closet
and throwing out another to wear to work in the morning.</p>

<p>She lay for nearly an hour thinking over the
events of the night but slept at last the sleep of weary
youth and was only roused by the importunate alarm
clock at six thirty. On her way to the bathroom for
a shower&mdash;the shower had been a concession to her
and Roy&mdash;she passed Ethel whose good morning she
thought a little constrained. As she dressed she rehearsed
the story she meant to tell to account for her
late home-coming. Something would be said about it
and she went downstairs whistling to fortify herself
for the ordeal. Her father was reading the morning
paper by the window in the living room and in response
to her inquiry as to whether there was any news
muttered absently that there was nothing in particular,
the remark he always made when interrupted
in the reading of his paper.</p>

<p>She found her mother and sister in the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Grace,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland pleasantly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re a little late, so you might set the table.
Ethel and I have started breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland usually made a point of setting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
breakfast table herself and Grace wondered whether
this delegation of the task might not mean that her
mother and Ethel wished to be alone to discuss just
what should be said about her arrival at midnight
when they had every reason to expect her home from
her French lesson by half-past nine.</p>

<p>When they were established at the table Ethel
praised the clear bright morning. It was her habit to
say something hopeful and cheering at the breakfast
table, illuminated at times by an appropriate quotation.
Mrs. Durland encouraged this practice and if
Ethel did not at once volunteer her contribution to the
felicity of the matutinal meal, would ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethel, haven&#8217;t you some <i>word</i> for us this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel had offered a quotation from Emerson and
Grace had correctly guessed that it was from the essay
on &#8220;Compensation&#8221; when Mrs. Durland, having filled
and passed the coffee cups, glanced at Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kept you so late last night, dear?&#8221; she asked
in the kindest of tones. &#8220;I waited up till eleven. I
didn&#8217;t hear you come in. You must have been very
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t get in until twelve. After the lesson
I went home with Irene and there were some people
there and we just talked and played cards. I didn&#8217;t
know the time was passing till it was after eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather strange, dear. They didn&#8217;t <i>know</i>
at the Kirby&#8217;s that you were at their house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they know?&#8221; Grace demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we called up!&#8221; her mother answered.
&#8220;John Moore&#8217;s in town and telephoned about eight
o&#8217;clock to know if he could come out. Ethel talked
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s such a fine fellow,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;You know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
mother and I met him when we went down to see you
at the University last spring. He&#8217;s such a splendid
type!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The kind of high-minded, self-respecting young
man we like to have you know, Grace,&#8221; remarked Mrs.
Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;John&#8217;s a dear,&#8221; said Grace warmly. &#8220;And you told
him to go to Professor Duroy&#8217;s, and of course he
didn&#8217;t find me there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and he called a second time, thinking he had
misunderstood. He was very anxious to get you to
go with him to the football game tomorrow and was
afraid you might make some other engagement. It
was just a <i>little</i> embarrassing that we couldn&#8217;t tell
him where you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have told him to come to the store in
the morning,&#8221; Grace replied. &#8220;Well, I guess I may
as well make a clean breast of it! I played hooky!
Irene and I went to a supper party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you told me an untruth!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Durland,
staring wide-eyed at the culprit. &#8220;Grace, this
isn&#8217;t like you. You should have told me you were
not going to Professor Duroy&#8217;s. You might have
saved me my worry last night when you were so late
and the Kirbys said Irene had not been home and that
she told her family she was spending the night with a
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mamma: I shouldn&#8217;t have told you a fib. I&#8217;m
sorry. It was a dreadful sin!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked from one to the other smiling, hoping
to dispel the gloom that seemed to hang above the
table. It was not however in her sister&#8217;s mind to
suffer the deception to pass unrebuked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll tell us, I suppose, <i>whom</i> you had supper
with besides Irene?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Her sister&#8217;s question angered Grace the more by reason
of the tone of forbearance in which it was uttered.
She would tell them nothing. A crisis had risen in her
relations with her family and she resolved to meet it
boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not answer your question,&#8221; she said, addressing
herself directly to Ethel. &#8220;It&#8217;s none of your business
where I go or what I do. Ever since I came home I&#8217;ve
been staying in at night except when I&#8217;ve gone to a
movie with father. I&#8217;m working hard every day to
help keep things going here at home. And I mean
to keep on doing it; but I&#8217;m not a child and I&#8217;m
not going to be checked up for every hour I&#8217;m out
of your sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm yourself, Grace. Don&#8217;t say anything you&#8217;ll
be sorry for!&#8221; admonished Mrs. Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;After I&#8217;d warned you about the Kirby girl&mdash;&#8221;
began Ethel with the serene patience due an erring
child who may yet be saved from further misdemeanors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you warned me all right enough!&#8221; Grace interrupted.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a lot to make things pleasant
for me since I came home! When I asked those
girls here to the house you made everything as disagreeable
as possible. You shied from a harmless
ouija board! And now if I go out for an evening
you&#8217;re terribly shocked because I lie about it and
refuse to tell you exactly where I&#8217;ve been! But I do
refuse! I&#8217;m never going to tell you anything! The
sooner you understand that, Ethel Durland, the sooner
we&#8217;ll have peace in this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes were bright with tears but she held her
head high. In so far as she reasoned at all in her
anger she was satisfied that justice was on her side.
She was of age, she was self-supporting, she was bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
her full share of the family expenses, and she
meant to establish once and for all her right to freedom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t expected you to take the matter in this
spirit,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t like you, Grace.
We want the very best for you. We want you to
have your friends and to enjoy yourself. And be
sure we all appreciate the fine way you met your
disappointment at being obliged to give up college.
But you know we owe it to you, dear, to protect you
in every way possible. There are so many perils
these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only here, but everywhere through the country,
the moral conditions are terrible,&#8221; said Ethel
plaintively. &#8220;A young girl can&#8217;t be too careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m wicked your goodness more than
makes up for it,&#8221; Grace flashed back; and then, her
anger mounting, &#8220;Why do you assume that I&#8217;ve been
wicked? Are you going to take my character away
from me right here at home? If I&#8217;ve got to live here
in an atmosphere of suspicion I&#8217;ll leave. I can easily
find another boarding place where I won&#8217;t be pecked
at all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think of doing that!&#8221; cried her
mother aghast. &#8220;This is your home, dear; it will
always be your home. We should be so grateful that
we&#8217;ve been able to keep the dear old place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re making me think of it! If I go
you&#8217;ll be driving me out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one has any intention of driving you from
home,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;We want to guard you with
our faith and love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your faith!&#8221; Grace laughed ironically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we have all the faith in the world in
you!&#8221; declared Mrs. Durland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Stephen Durland, who had remained silent during
this discussion, was now folding his napkin. He
cleared his throat, glanced from his wife to his daughters
and back to his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me this has gone far enough, Alicia.
There&#8217;s no use acting as though Grace had done anything
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we didn&#8217;t mean that, Stephen,&#8221; said
Mrs. Durland quickly. &#8220;It was <i>only</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact that Durland so rarely expressed an opinion
on any matter pertaining to family affairs had
so surprised her that she found herself unequal to
the task of completing her sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s a good place to let the matter drop,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The way to show Grace we trust her is to
trust her. Twelve o&#8217;clock is not late. I heard Grace
when she came in. I don&#8217;t blame her for not answering
questions when she&#8217;s jumped on. Don&#8217;t nag
Grace. Grace is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the longest speech Stephen Durland had
delivered in a family council for years. He rose,
paused to drain the glass of water at his plate and left
the room. A moment later the front door closed very
softly. The gentleness with which it closed had curiously
the effect of an emphasis upon his last words.
They waited to give him time to reach the gate. Having
broken one precedent he might break another;
he might come back. He had even addressed his
wife as Alicia instead of the familiar Allie&mdash;a radical
and disconcerting departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may as well clear the table,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland,
when a full minute had passed. Grace assisted
in the clearing up. All the processes of this labor
were executed in silence save for an occasional deep
sigh from Mrs. Durland. When the dishes had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
washed and put away in the pantry Grace hung up
her apron and went to her room. She made her bed
and straightened up her dressing table and had put
on her hat and coat when Ethel appeared in the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace, I want you to know how sorry I am if I
said anything to hurt you. You know that not for
worlds would I be unkind or unjust to my own sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right, Ethel; just forget it,&#8221; Grace
replied indifferently.</p>

<p>She bade her mother good-bye with all the cheer
she could muster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Grace,&#8221; called Mrs. Durland from the
window where she was scanning the newspaper. &#8220;I
hope you&#8217;ll have a good day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, mother.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>As the trolley bore her townward she decided that
all things considered she had come off fairly well
in the encounter; but she was not jubilant. She had
probably established her right to go and come as
she pleased, but the victory brought her no happiness.
Ethel&#8217;s conciliatory words meant nothing; it
was her sister&#8217;s way to manifest forbearance and
tolerance, to smooth things over when there had been
a clash between them. Grace had for her mother
a real affection, sincerely admiring the effort she
made to keep in touch with the best thought of the
world&mdash;a pet phrase of Mrs. Durland&#8217;s. Mrs. Durland
was kind, unselfish, well-meaning. She meant
to live up to her ideal of motherhood. It was
despicable to lie to her. Grace&#8217;s conscience was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
busy tearing down the defenses behind which she had
excused herself for going to Kemp&#8217;s party. Any
uncertainty as to Irene&#8217;s relations with the manufacturer
were dispelled by the visit to The Shack. The
fact that Kemp&#8217;s money made it possible to surround
the relationship with a degree of glamour did not
mitigate the ugly fact. It might be that the people
who talked so dolefully of the new generation and
the low ebb to which old-fashioned morals had sunk
were right. Irene&#8217;s affair with Kemp presented a
situation which, if greatly multiplied, would mean
the destruction of all that made womanhood precious.</p>

<p>Could she, Grace Durland, ever be like that? What
was to prevent her from doing exactly what Irene
was doing or falling even lower? Nothing, she pondered,
but her own will and innate sense of righteousness.
She would have no excuse for following Irene&#8217;s
example. The home she had just left really stood
for all those things she had been taught to believe
were essential to right living. Her mother, with all
her failings and weaknesses, had labored hard to implant
in her children the principles of honor and rectitude.
And her father, pitiful figure though he was,
was a man of ideals and a pattern of morality. He
believed in her; he was her friend and it would be
shameful to do aught to bring disgrace upon him.
And with an accession of generosity as she pondered,
Grace saw Ethel, too, in a different light. With all
her offensive assumption of saintly airs Ethel&#8217;s ideas
of human conduct were sound. Ethel was a disagreeable
person to live with, but nevertheless she was
not always wrong. She had indubitably been right
about Irene Kirby.</p>

<p>As Grace left the car she saw by a street clock
that she still had ten minutes in which to report at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the store and she loitered, eager to remain in the open
as long as possible. And she rather dreaded meeting
Irene.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Happily for her peace of mind the day opened
briskly. She had disposed of a rapid succession of
customers before Irene, who had arrived late, passed
her in the salesroom with a careless nod and smile.
At half-past nine Grace espied John Moore, the unwitting
cause of the exposure of her truancy from
the French class, standing in the entrance. So many
other thoughts had filled her mind since she left
the breakfast table that she had forgotten about
Moore and the football game. She was carrying a
gown she had just sold flung over her arm when the
sight of the young man, who was clearly dismayed
by the unfamiliar scene, brought a smile to her face.
He sprang forward beaming when he caught sight
of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just about to run; I&#8217;m scared to death!&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>In his joy at finding her he dropped his hat as he
grasped her hand. He was big of frame but trained
fine, and the deep tan of his summer on a Kansas
farm had not yet worn off. His gray suit was only
saved from shabbiness by a recent careful pressing.
His lean cheeks were neatly shaven and his thick
brown hair was evenly parted and smoothly brushed,
though a wisp of it persisted in slipping down over
his forehead. Twenty-seven or thereabouts, John
Barton Moore&mdash;as he was written on the university
books&mdash;seemed older with the maturity of one who
begins early to plan and fashion his life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully glad to see you, John!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Up for the game, of course! I was terribly sorry not
to be home when you called. The trouble was that
I cut my French lesson at the last minute to go to
a party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly all right, Grace. I ought to have written
you a note to say I was coming up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced about anxiously. &#8220;Am I blocking the
wheels of commerce?&#8221; he asked with the drawl that
proclaimed him one of those children of Indiana
whose ancestors reached the Wabash country by way
of North Carolina and Kentucky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like that! Just a minute till I send this
dress to be packed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She motioned him to a chair but he remained standing
like a soldier at attention till she came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then! Let&#8217;s proceed to business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I. U. needs all her children to root this
afternoon, though I think we&#8217;re going to win. And
you&#8217;ve got to go. Got good seats and everything&#8217;s
all set.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, John, I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t go. Saturdays are
busy days here. I don&#8217;t like to ask to get off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can fix it somehow. And besides I want
to talk. I&#8217;ve got about a million things to tell you.
You left in such a hurry I didn&#8217;t know you were gone
till Roy told me the next day. I&#8217;ve certainly missed
our talks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have some more; I&#8217;m starving for a
talk with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is a fearsome place and I mustn&#8217;t keep
you. So please see your boss and tell him or her this
is a matter of life and death.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Irene swept by with a valued
customer and Grace appealed to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;Miss Kirby, Mr. Moore. Irene, Mr. Moore is an
old friend of mine from I. U. and he wants me to
go to the game. Would I be shot if I asked to get
off?&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene surveyed Moore carefully and weighed the
question for an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I get if I fix it?&#8221; she asked, giving the
young man the benefit of her handsome eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might offer a bushel of hickory-nuts,&#8221; said
Moore. &#8220;I counted a lot on seeing the game with
Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Irene with mock gravity, &#8220;I <i>think</i>
it can be arranged. Miss Boardman sent word this
morning that she&#8217;s ill and won&#8217;t be down, so I&#8217;m in
charge. We&#8217;re likely to have a busy afternoon, but
you run along, Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s mighty nice of you, Miss Kirby&#8221;; and
Moore thrust out his hand. It was evidently his habit
to express all manner of emotion with a handshake.
He was regarding Irene with a frank curiosity manifest
in his steady gray eyes. The grand manner of
the Irenes of the world, one would have assumed, was
new to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could go along too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
likely to be a lively scrap. If you say the word, Miss
Kirby, I&#8217;ll get another seat right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you so much! But with Miss Boardman
away it can&#8217;t be done. It&#8217;s nice of you to ask
me though.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she was to him a puzzling type, alien to all his
experience, he was equally of an unfamiliar species
to her. Grace noted with secret amusement the interest
they apparently awakened in each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me; I must run along,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;Have
a good time!&#8221; She left them with her queenliest air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;I told you it could be fixed all right,&#8221; said Moore.
&#8220;Fine girl; Miss Kirby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was mighty nice of her to do it. I&#8217;d hardly
have had the nerve to tackle Miss Boardman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I mustn&#8217;t keep you. There&#8217;s lots of folks
on the streets. Looks like the whole of the grand old
Hoosier State was in town. Where can I meet you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the main entrance of this emporium at one
o&#8217;clock. You get your lunch first and I&#8217;ll snatch
something in the tea room. We&#8217;ll want to get out
early to see the crowd gather. I&#8217;m that thrilled,
John!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace greeted her next customer with a smile that
was not wholly inspired by the hope of making a substantial
sale. John had been one of her best friends
at the university, where every one knew and liked him.
Even the governor of the State knew Moore and referred
to him indirectly in public addresses as a justification
for taxing the people to place higher education
within reach of the humblest.</p>

<p>Moore was born on a farm and his parents dying
just as he finished the common schools, he had worked
his way through college, doing chores during the
school terms and spending his vacations on farms
wherever employment offered. In like fashion he was
now plodding his way through the law school. His
good humor was unfailing and his drolleries were
much quoted in the university town. When urged in
his undergraduate days to take up football he pleaded
important engagements, not scrupling to explain that
they were the most solemn pledges to saw wood or
cut grass for his clients or drive the truck on Saturdays
for a grocer. He called his employers his noble
patrons and praised them for their consideration and
generosity. He enjoyed music, and possessing a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
baritone voice he had been enrolled in the glee club.
He never had danced until, in his senior year, a number
of co-eds conspired to instruct him. He was the
star performer of the debating society and had several
times represented the university in the contests
of the Inter-State Association.</p>

<p>Though she had so quickly overcome her disappointment
at leaving the University, Grace found that the
sight of Moore awoke in her a keen regret that her college
days were over. She was far less sure of herself
than she had been before her evening at The Shack.
She clutched at memories of her happy care-free yesterdays.
A band in the street was playing the air of the
college song, which was punctuated by the familiar
yell from the throats of a mighty phalanx of undergraduates.
Young women from all the state colleges
were coming into the store for hurried purchases. Two
members of her sorority, girls she had lived with for
two years, dropped in to see her&mdash;cheery, hopeful
young women, eagerly flinging at her scraps of college
news and giving a sharper edge to her homesickness
for the campus and all it connoted. She was
beset with serious doubts as to her fitness to meet
the problems of life; the conceit was gone out of her.
She recalled what a lecturer had once said at a student&#8217;s
convocation, that the great commonwealth of
Indiana stood behind them, eager to serve them, to
put them in the way of realizing the abundant promise
of life. In her mood of contrition she reflected
that not only had the arm of the State been withdrawn,
but that she had gone far toward estranging
those to whom she was bound by the closest ties, who
had every right to expect the best of her. If it had
been in her power she would have elected to join the
throng of young men and women who, victor or vanquished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
would go back to the university that night
singing songs which echoed in her memory now and
made a continuing little ache in her heart.</p>

<p>Moore&#8217;s pride in her was manifest as he hung to
a strap and bent over her in the crowded street-car
on the way to the battlefield. Grace was a pretty
girl, and John was not unmindful of the fact that she
attracted attention. He talked steadily&mdash;of university
affairs, of their friends among the students.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Roy come up?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him. He may have come up with
the bunch this morning. But you might overlook the
king of England in this crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy&#8217;s not terribly enthusiastic about the law,&#8221; she
suggested leadingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe not just what you&#8217;ll call crazy about
it; but he&#8217;ll come along all right. There&#8217;s good stuff
in Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore was usually so candid that his equivocal answer
did not escape her. Grace had the greatest
misgivings as to her brother&#8217;s future. He had wanted
to leave the university when she was summoned home.
He had won his A. B. by the narrowest margin and
had gone into the law school only because of his mother&#8217;s
obsession that he was destined to a career similar
to that of her father and grandfather, whose attainments
at the bar and services to the State provided
what Mrs. Durland called a background for her
children.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Arriving early at the ball park they found their
seats and John continued talking as the crowd assembled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
On many Sunday afternoons they had taken
long tramps, discussing all manner of things. Moore
was a prodigious reader of poetry and made it his
practice to commit to memory a certain number of
lines every day. Politics, too, interested him seriously.
He always spoke with deepest reverence of the
founders of the republic, referring to them familiarly
as though they were still living. Between the cheers
to which he vociferously contributed his own voice,
he rambled on comfortably and happily, satisfied that
he had a sympathetic auditor.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Bill Trumbull&mdash;hello there, Bill! Well,
to tell the truth, Grace, I don&#8217;t get much out of this
new poetry. Flimsy stuff; doesn&#8217;t satisfy you somehow.
The times call for another old Walt Whitman.
That bird had ideas. He certainly hit some
grand old truths. &#8216;Produce great men,&#8217; he says;
&#8216;the rest follows.&#8217; Just as easy! Wow! There&#8217;s
our team coming out now!&#8221; (prolonged cheering)
&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s the old saying that the time brings
the man. Can&#8217;t tell but there&#8217;s a future president
right here in this crowd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be you, John!&#8221; remarked Grace, laughing
at the serenity with which he returned to his
subject after joining in the uproar.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Grace; I&#8217;ve chosen the chief justiceship!&#8221; he
said, swinging round at her. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that Daisy Martin?&mdash;Fred
Ragsdale with her. Hello, Fred! and if,
there ain&#8217;t old Pop Streeter! Greetings Pop! No, sir;
the times call for men and we&#8217;re going to produce a
fine new crop right out of this generation here present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore was enjoying himself; there was no question
of it. And Grace was experiencing a grateful sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of security in John&#8217;s company. He was paying her
his highest compliment, and she knew that the money
for his excursion to the capital had been earned by
his own labor. Her girl friends at the university had
tormented her a good deal about John&#8217;s attentions,
which were marked by the shy deference and instinctive
courtesy with which he treated all women. He
was not a person to be flirted with; Grace had never
in the prevalent phrase &#8220;teased him along.&#8221; She respected
him too much for that, and, moreover, he was
not fair game. Any attempt to practice on him the
usual cajoleries and coquetries would have sent him
away running. When a girl visitor at the university,
meeting John at a dance, had referred to him as a
hick, Grace had resented it on the spot, informing
the surprised offender that John Moore was the finest
gentleman on the campus.</p>

<p>John was not wholly silenced by the spirited opening
of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad Crump&#8217;s not here. Hurt his leg last
week in practice. Thought he&#8217;d make it. Break his
heart not to be in the game. Thompson in his place.
You know Thompy? He&#8217;s a wonder on the trap
drum. Wow! Illinois got the ball. Where was I?
Oh, yes! I read Landor last summer&mdash;Walter Savage;
a theological student from New York, working
along with me out in Kansas, put me on to Landor.
Quite a man&mdash;Landor, I mean. The theolog&#8217;s a bully
chap, too, for that matter. Look at that! No; sending
&#8217;em back. Wow! That&#8217;s first blood for us! Well,
you might like Landor if you took a whack at him.
That referee&#8217;s awful fussy. Wonder where they got
him. Remember that day we read &#8216;The Passing of
Arthur,&#8217; sitting on a log by that gay little creek in
the woods? I&#8217;ve thought a lot about that and the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
you <i>cried</i>. Yes; you did, Grace; and I guess I shed
a few tears myself!...&#8221;</p>

<p>In moments of despair when Indiana&#8217;s fortunes
were low, John&#8217;s optimism evoked laughter from his
neighbors, for he possessed in good measure the
homely humor which is indigenous to the corn-belt.</p>

<p>Before the game ended it had occurred to Grace
to ask John to go home with her for supper. After
they had joined in the demonstration for the victorious
Hoosier team and had made their way to the
street she went into a drugstore and called her mother
on the telephone. Mrs. Durland replied cordially
that she would be delighted to see John; it was too
late to put on any extras but any friend of Grace&#8217;s was
always welcome. It would serve to ease the situation
she had left behind her to take John home, Grace reflected,
and moreover, she was glad of an excuse for
seeing more of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll be glad to break bread with you.
I&#8217;ll be glad to see your folks again. If you&#8217;re not
too tired, let&#8217;s walk. Fine zippy air! Well, that was
sure some game! I nearly died an unnatural death
about seven times in the last quarter, but we managed
to pull through. Let&#8217;s see, what were we talking
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>He let her into a great secret as they crossed the
park toward the Durland house. He had seen Judge
Sanders, the senior member of one of the best law
firms in the capital and a university trustee, who had
offered to take him into his office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wants me to come in January,&#8221; John explained.
&#8220;Says they&#8217;ll guarantee my board and keep for running
errands and attending to collections; and I can
go on studying and be ready for my exams in the
spring just the same. So I&#8217;ll be in the city for keeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
after Christmas. Grand man, the Judge. Found I
was washing automobiles at night to pay for my room
over Westlake&#8217;s garage and he just couldn&#8217;t stand
it. There&#8217;s a friend, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited for her to laugh and laughed with
her. It was enormously funny that among other
jobs he washed automobiles on his way to the chief
justiceship!</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can keep you back, John. You&#8217;re like
the men we read about, who strike right out for the
top and get there and plant their flag on the battlements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say a word! There&#8217;s luck as well as hard
work in this business of getting on. All summer I
used to think about it&mdash;out in the fields in Kansas.
A big, hot harvest field&#8217;s a grand place for healthy
thought. I say, Grace, life&#8217;s a lot more complicated
than it used to be. Things all sort o&#8217; mixed up since
the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really believe the world&#8217;s so different, John?
Everybody&#8217;s saying that and the papers and magazines
are full of stuff about the changes and knocking
our generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that talk throw you! It&#8217;s up to all
of us to sit tight on the toboggan and wait till she
slows down. There&#8217;s a lot of good in this grand old
world yet. By the way, it was hard luck you had
to quit college. Excuse me for mentioning it, but
I just wanted you to know I was sorry you left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right, John. I miss the good times but
there&#8217;s no use crying. I&#8217;m ashamed now, though, to
think how I just fooled along. I ought to have got
more out of it than I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how much you got,&#8221; he replied
quickly. &#8220;Kind of a mystery what we get and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
we don&#8217;t. We got to keep braced for anything we
bump into. When the war came along I thought that
was the end of me so far as going into the law was
concerned, but being shot at by the Kaiser sort o&#8217;
made me mad. I wasn&#8217;t going to let a little thing like
that stop me; so my life being providentially spared,
I thought it all out on the ship coming home&mdash;on the
deck at night with the stars blinking at me. I&#8217;ve got
health and a fair second-rate head and I&#8217;m going to
give the world a good wrestle before I quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; she exclaimed, noting the lifting of his
head as he swung along in the gathering dusk. &#8220;You
make me ashamed of myself, John. I think I&#8217;ve
begun to drift&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m headed for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all think we&#8217;re drifting when we&#8217;re not! It&#8217;s
in the back of our minds all the time that we&#8217;re aiming
for something,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;we don&#8217;t fool ourselves
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re right,&#8221; she said, pensively. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve
wondered a lot lately about myself. Do you suppose
there&#8217;s anything wrong with me&mdash;lack of ambition,
maybe?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused abruptly the more emphatically to dispose
of her question, which had a deeper meaning
than he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, Grace! You could keep up your
college work if you wanted to&mdash;there&#8217;s a way of doing
that, and get your degree. Suppose you thought
of that&mdash;and teaching?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But I don&#8217;t feel any strong pull that way.
I&#8217;m in a French class and I mean to keep that up.
But before I was off the campus I was all keyed up
to jump right into things. I want experiences&mdash;not
teaching or anything like that&mdash;but to be as close to
the heart of things as I can get!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;Not a bit of fault with that! I&#8217;d trust you to
find yourself anywhere. You&#8217;re too fine a girl ever
to get lost in the shuffle. I guess you&#8217;ll learn a lot
in Shipley&#8217;s; you see all kinds of people there every
day, and as Aleck Pope says the proper study of mankind
is man&mdash;also woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of herself the unhappiness with which the
day had begun had stolen into her heart again. It
had betrayed itself in her speech, the eagerness with
which she appealed to Moore for approval and sympathy.
She was contrasting what he was saying with
what Trenton had said the previous night. No two
men could be more unlike&mdash;Trenton the man of the
world, with a hint of cynicism in his attitude toward
life; John Moore, a son of the soil, with all his ideals
intact, viewing life with hope and confidence.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Grace had not been mistaken in thinking that John&#8217;s
presence would exert a cheering influence on the
household. It was clearly written in the faces of
Mrs. Durland and Ethel that they believed Grace was
not beyond redemption so long as she was capable
of appreciating the sterling worth of a high-minded
and ambitious young man like Moore. John was not
without a sense of the fitness of things. When Mrs.
Durland and Ethel showed a disposition to maintain
the conversation on lofty heights John indulged them
for a time and then concentrated upon Stephen
Durland. Farm machinery seemed to John a subject
likely to interest the silent head of the house.
Durland was soon painstakingly answering Moore&#8217;s
questions as to the possibility of further reducing
the man power required in crop production.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve hopped the clods since I could reach a plow
handle,&#8221; said John, &#8220;and it does seem to me that with
the tractor coming in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland delivered what amounted to a condensed
lecture on the subject, spurred on by John&#8217;s sincere
interest and practical questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Durland. I&#8217;ve been wanting to
get an expert opinion on those points for a long time.
I tell you,&#8221; he said glancing round at the others, &#8220;it
does tickle me to run into a man who really <i>knows</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s an authority on those things,&#8221; said Grace
proudly. &#8220;He reads everything that&#8217;s written on mechanics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stephen <i>ought</i> to know!&#8221; remarked Mrs. Durland
with a sigh which Grace translated as signifying that
it was too bad that his knowing really profited him
so little.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so sorry,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland, when the
cold ham, baked potatoes and canned peas had received
attention and Ethel brought in a bread pudding&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s
a great grief to all of us that Grace had to leave
college. It meant so much to her. But her spirit
about it all has been fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked John, after he had met Ethel&#8217;s
apology for the pudding with the assurance that it
was his favorite of all desserts&mdash;&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not sure
it isn&#8217;t a good thing for Grace to go into business
for awhile. I argue that things somehow work out for
good in the long run. Her English and the sociology
courses were what interested her most; and being in
a big place like Shipley&#8217;s and running into all sorts
and conditions of folks the way she&#8217;s got to is bound to
have a broadening effect. It&#8217;s right along the line
of things she&#8217;s keenest about.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;But, Mr. Moore, what we don&#8217;t like is the unfortunate
contacts with people who may not be&mdash;<i>wholly</i>
desirable acquaintances,&#8221; suggested Ethel.</p>

<p>Grace frowned. It was ungracious of Ethel to
draw John into the discussion of a subject that had
been a matter of contention in the family. But John,
having convinced Mrs. Durland of his appreciation
of her hospitality by accepting a second helping of
the pudding, met the situation promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now Miss Durland, who&#8217;s going to draw
the line between the desirable and undesirable? Now
I&#8217;m not saying that we haven&#8217;t a right to choose our
friends; but for me, I like all kinds. Why, on that
farm in Kansas where I slept in the hay mow for the
sake of the ventilation and to study the constellations
through the cracks, a fugitive burglar crawled in
one night and we nearly scared each other to death!
But I made a friend of that poor chap. Tucked him
away and fed him for a couple of days. Had a letter
from him last week. He&#8217;s away up in Canada
working in a lumber camp. Now sleeping in the hay
with that poor devil didn&#8217;t do me any harm. Maybe
I did him some good! He swore he wasn&#8217;t guilty,
so my conscience was easy about not calling up the
sheriff and turning him over. Give everybody the
benefit of the doubt; that&#8217;s my idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not Ethel&#8217;s way to give any one the benefit
of the doubt. Mr. Durland covered a queer little
chuckle by pretending to cough. Grace tried to change
the subject; but Ethel was not to be thwarted in
her attempt to elicit from John an expression of disapproval
of Grace&#8217;s course in becoming a salesgirl.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good story, Mr. Moore, but when you
think of a girl like Grace, being <i>numbered</i> and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
in with girls who&#8217;ve had nothing like her advantages&mdash;that&#8217;s
what I meant. Not that Grace won&#8217;t be
equal to the test, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; John interrupted, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been in these
big stores much but this morning while I was trying
to get my eye on Grace I saw all those girls stepping
round and I thought what a fine looking lot they
were! And all busy and right on the job! Now there&#8217;s
that Miss Kirby&mdash;was that the name, Grace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Grace answered, strongly inclined to giggle,
now that the innocent and well-meaning John had
brought Irene to the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take a girl like that,&#8221; said John warming to
his work, &#8220;moving around like a duchess, and with
that way about her that makes you <i>know</i> she&#8217;s onto
her job! I&#8217;ll bet there&#8217;s lots of &#8217;em just like her. I
say you&#8217;ve got to hand it to &#8217;em. I tell you, Mrs. Durland,
while we&#8217;ve got girls like Miss Kirby and Grace
Durland I&#8217;ll say America&#8217;s safe! Wasn&#8217;t it nice,
Grace, the way Miss Kirby fixed it for you to get
off. You could see she was pleased clear through to
have the authority!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think&mdash;&#8221; began Ethel; but scenting battle,
Mrs. Durland rose from the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Mr. Moore go into the parlor, Grace.
Ethel and I will straighten up out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your tin-type!&#8221; John protested. &#8220;I just
love to dry dishes. You just let me take a hand.
I&#8217;ll pay for every plate I smash!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he refused to be denied Grace found an apron
for him and they made merry over the dishwashing.</p>

<p>While they were in the midst of it Ethel came to
the door to say that Grace was wanted on the telephone.
Ethel&#8217;s manner of conveying the information
prepared Grace for Irene&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;Can you talk a minute? I had a telegram from
some friends of ours this afternoon. They wanted to
be remembered to you; that&#8217;s all. I think your particular
friend will stop on his way east. Tell me, did
you get in bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right now,&#8221; Grace replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
company and we mustn&#8217;t talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand perfectly. I&#8217;m spending an evening
at home for a change and I just thought I&#8217;d let you
know our gay cavaliers hadn&#8217;t forgotten us. Is your
company exciting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just nice. You met him this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d guessed it. And you took him home for supper,
like the good little girl you are! Well, it&#8217;s a joy
to meet one of the unvarnished occasionally. I may
try to take him away from you; just hand him that!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIX</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> repentant mood induced by the spectacle of
the football game and John Moore&#8217;s visit still lay
upon Grace the next morning when she went down
to the Durland eight o&#8217;clock Sunday breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you hurried down,&#8221; said her mother
cheerily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you girls to come into the
kitchen Sunday mornings; you&#8217;re both tired from your
week&#8217;s work and I want you to make the Sabbath a
real day of rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m for getting up when I wake up,&#8221; Grace
answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling fine. Let me do the toast,
Ethel. I just love toasting.&#8221;</p>

<p>She led the talk at the table, recurring to the football
game, exploring the newspaper for the sporting
page to clarify her impressions of certain points in
the contest.</p>

<p>&#8220;John was simply a scream! He talked of everything
under the sun. You might have thought he
didn&#8217;t want me to know what was going on at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>John was the safest of topics; they had all liked
him; and Grace related many stories illustrative of
the young man&#8217;s determination to refuse no task by
which he could earn the dollars he needed to lodge,
clothe and feed himself while gaining his education.
Now that they had seen him at their own table they
could the better enjoy Grace&#8217;s enumeration of John&#8217;s
sturdy qualities.</p>

<p>This was the happiest breakfast the Durlands had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
known since Grace came home. It was in her heart
to do her full share in promoting the cheer of the
household. The unfortunate revelation of her duplicity
of Friday night would no doubt be forgotten
if she behaved herself; and she had no intention of
repeating the offense. Nevertheless she was glad that
she had asserted herself. It had done no harm to
declare her right to independent action and the exercise
of her own judgment in the choice of friends;
she would have had no peace, she assured herself, if
she hadn&#8217;t taken a stand against an espionage that
would have been intolerable. She persuaded herself
that her mother and sister were treating her with much
more respect now that she had shown that she couldn&#8217;t
be frightened or cowed by their criticisms.</p>

<p>Before breakfast was over Ethel asked quite casually
whether Grace wouldn&#8217;t go to church with her,
and Mrs. Durland promptly approved the invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go as well as not, Grace. Ethel has her
Sunday school class first, but she can meet you right
afterwards. I don&#8217;t want you girls bothering with the
Sunday dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace didn&#8217;t question that this matter had been
canvassed privately by Ethel and her mother; very
likely it had been Ethel&#8217;s suggestion; but she decided
instantly that it would be good policy to go. Her
church-going had always been desultory and her
mother had ceased to insist on it. But the situation
called for a concession on her part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes; thank you ever so much, Ethel,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been in ages. I&#8217;d meant to do some
sewing but that can wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland, &#8220;we all need the
help and inspiration of the church. Stephen, wouldn&#8217;t
you like to go with the girls? I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
ever heard Dr. Ridgley; he&#8217;s very liberal and a stimulating
speaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland mumbled an incoherent rejection of the
idea; then looked up from his reading to explain
that he had some things to attend to at the shop.
There was nothing surprising in the explanation. He
always went to his shop on Sunday mornings. Even
in the old days of his identification with Cummings-Durland
he had betaken himself every Sunday to the
factory to ponder his problems.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>As the congregation assembled Grace yielded herself
to the spell of the organ, whose inspiring strains gave
wings to her imagination. Always impressionable, she
felt that she had brought her soul humbled and
chastened into the sanctuary. Here were the evidences
of those more excellent things that had been
pointed out to her from her earliest youth. The
service opened spiritedly with the singing of a
familiar hymn which touched chords in her heart that
had long been silent. She joined in the singing and
in the responsive reading of a selection of the Psalms.
She had read somewhere that the church, that Christianity
indeed, was losing its hold upon the mind and
the conscience of mankind. But this church was
filled; many men and women must still be finding a
tangible help in the precepts and example of Jesus.</p>

<p>Ethel, sitting beside her, certainly found here something
that brought her back Sunday after Sunday, and
made her a zealous helper in the church activities.
Bigoted and intolerant, unkind and ungenerous as
Ethel was, there was something in her devotion to the
church that set her a little apart, spoke for something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
fine in her, that for the moment caused Grace a
twinge of envy. In her early youth she had &#8220;joined&#8221;
the West End church that her mother attended;
but before she left high school the connection
had ceased to interest her. Dr. Ridgley&#8217;s congregation
was composed largely of the prosperous and
well-to-do. Did these people about her really order
their lives in keeping with the teachings of Jesus?
Was the Christian life a possible thing? Were these
women in their smart raiment really capable of living
in love and charity with their neighbors, eager to help,
to serve, to save? Absorbed in her own thoughts she
missed the text; found herself studying the minister,
a young man of quiet manner and pleasing voice.
Then detached sentences arrested her truant thoughts,
and soon she was giving his utterances her complete
attention.</p>

<p>... &#8220;Leaving God out of the question,&#8221; he was
saying, &#8220;what excuse have we to offer ourselves if
we fail to do what we know to be right? We must
either confess to a weakness in our own fibre, or lay
the burden on some one else. We must be either
captain or slave.... We hear much about the
changed spirit of the time. It is said that the old barricades
no longer shield us from evil; that the checks
upon our moral natures are broken down; that many
of the old principles of uprightness and decent living
have been superseded by something new, which makes
it possible for us to do very much as we please without
harm to our souls. Let us not be deceived by
such reasoning. There&#8217;s altogether too much talk
about the changes that are going on. There are no
new temptations; they merely wear a new guise. The
soul and its needs do not change; the God who ever
lives and loves does not change.... There&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
limit upon our capacity for self-deception. We may
think we are free, but at a certain point we find that
after all we are the prisoners of conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;The business of life is a series of transactions between
the individual soul and God. We can change
that relationship only by our own folly. We can deceive
ourselves with excuses; but the test of an excuse
is whether it will pass muster with God. God
is not mocked; we can&#8217;t &#8216;just get by&#8217; with God. We
may be sure that we are pretty close to a realization
of the Christian life when we feel that we have an
excuse for any sin or failure that we dare breathe
into a prayer. There&#8217;s hope for all of us as long as
our sins are such that we&#8217;re not ashamed to carry them
to God.... Let us live on good terms with
ourselves first of all and with God be the rest. Let
us keep in harmony with that power above us and
beyond us which in all ages has made for righteousness.&#8221;...</p>

<p>The minister was uttering clearly and forcibly the
thoughts that had been creeping through her own
mind like tired heralds feebly crying warning to a
threatened fortress. Captain or slave, that was the
question. She had told Trenton that she was afraid
of the answers to vexed problems of life and conduct.
She saw now the cowardice of this. Her intelligence
she knew to be above the average, and her conscience
had within twenty-four hours proved itself
to be uncomfortably sensitive and vigilant. There
might be breaks in the old moral barriers but if this
were really true it would be necessary for her to
stumble over the debris to gain the inviting freedom
of the territory beyond. No; there would be no excuse
for her if she failed to fashion something fine
and noble of her life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>In the vestibule Ethel introduced her to the minister,
who greeted her warmly and praised Ethel; she
was one of his standbys he said. While he and Ethel
were conferring about some matter connected with
the young people&#8217;s society Grace was accosted by a
lady whom she identified at once as her first customer
at Shipley&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know you or not?&#8221; demanded Miss Reynolds
pleasantly. &#8220;Hats make such a difference, but I
thought I recognized you. I&#8217;ve been away so many
years that I look twice at every one I meet. I was
caught in England by the war and just stayed on. It
gives you a queer feeling to find yourself a stranger in
your native town. It was silly of me to stay away
so long. Well, how are things going with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just fine,&#8221; Grace answered, noting that Miss Reynolds
wore one of the suits she had sold her, and
looked very well in it.</p>

<p>The old lady (the phrase was ridiculous in the case
of one so alert and spirited) caught the glance; indeed
nothing escaped the bright eyes behind Beulah Reynolds&#8217;
spectacles. She bent toward Grace and whispered:
&#8220;This suit&#8217;s very satisfactory!&#8221; And then:
&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve caught each other in a good place. My
grandfather was one of the founders of this church,
so I dropped in to have a look. Haven&#8217;t seen more
than a dozen people I used to know. There was a
good deal of sense in that sermon; the best I&#8217;ve heard
in years. They don&#8217;t scatter fire and brimstone the
way they used to.&#8221;</p>

<p>One would have thought from her manner that
she was enormously relieved to find that fire and
brimstone had been abandoned as a stimulus to the
Christian life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a member,&#8221; said Grace, &#8220;but my sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
is. I never heard Dr. Ridgley before. I liked his
sermon; I think I needed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was smiling but something a little wistful
in her tone caused Miss Reynolds to regard her with
keen scrutiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, you&#8217;ve come into my mind frequently
since our meeting at the store? I&#8217;ve thought
of you&mdash;uncommercially, I mean, if that&#8217;s the way to
put it! I&#8217;d like to know you better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Miss Reynolds; I&#8217;ve thought of
you, too, and have hoped you&#8217;d come into Shipley&#8217;s
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, clothes don&#8217;t interest me a particle; I may
not visit Shipley&#8217;s again for years! But that doesn&#8217;t
mean I shan&#8217;t see you. I wonder if you&#8217;d come to my
house some evening for dinner&mdash;just ourselves. Would
that bore you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; Grace responded smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner the better then! Tomorrow evening
shall we say? Don&#8217;t think of dressing. Come direct
from your work. Here&#8217;s my address on this card.
I&#8217;ll send my motor for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t trouble to do that! I can easily come
out on the street-car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suit yourself. It&#8217;s almost like kidnapping and&mdash;it
just occurs to me that I don&#8217;t really know your name!&#8221;
Her ignorance of Grace&#8217;s name greatly amused Miss
Reynolds. &#8220;For all you know this might be a scheme
to snare you to my house and murder you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll cheerfully take the chance!&#8221; laughed Grace,
and gave her name. The minister had now finished
with Ethel, and Grace introduced her sister to Miss
Reynolds, who did not, however, include Ethel in her
invitation to dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;She charmingly eccentric,&#8221; Ethel remarked as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Miss Reynolds turned away. &#8220;And awfully rich; one
of the richest woman taxpayers in the state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I understand she is,&#8221; said Grace without
enthusiasm. &#8220;But we needn&#8217;t hold that against her.&#8221;
And then, recalling Ethel&#8217;s complacent tone in mentioning
any social recognition by her church friends,
Grace remarked carelessly, &#8220;She&#8217;s invited me to dine
with her tomorrow night. I&#8217;m to be the only guest.
She seems to have a crush on me!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the midday dinner Ethel disclosed Miss Reynolds&#8217;
partiality for Grace with all impressiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Grace!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Durland, &#8220;do you
fully <i>appreciate</i> what that means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that a very nice lady has invited me to
share her dinner,&#8221; Grace answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you realize,&#8221; said Ethel, &#8220;what a great compliment
that is. Why, she can do worlds for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping she keeps a good cook!&#8221; Grace retorted,
irritated that they were attributing so much
importance to what she preferred to look upon as
no more than an act of spontaneous kindness in a
generous hearted woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Reynolds represents the old conservative
element here,&#8221; Mrs. Durland remarked in a tone that
implied her deep reverence for that element of the population&mdash;&#8220;the
people who always stood for the best
things of life. Her father was a colonel in the
Civil War. They always had money. A woman like
that can make herself <i>felt</i>. Now that she&#8217;s back, I
hope she&#8217;ll see that she has a work to do. She has no
ties and with her position and wealth she can make
herself a power for good in checking the evil tendencies
so apparent in our city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s so quaint; so deliciously old-fashioned,&#8221;
added Ethel, &#8220;and you can see from her clothes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
she&#8217;s an independent character. I&#8217;m going to ask
Dr. Ridgely to invite her to take the chairmanship
of our girl&#8217;s club committee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be splendid, Ethel,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Durland, &#8220;perhaps <i>you</i> could say a word to her about
it, Grace. You know better than Ethel the dangers
and temptations of the girl wage-earner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I should,&#8221; Grace replied.
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t talk to me as though I had a monopoly
of all the wickedness in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace, dear, I didn&#8217;t <i>mean</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, mother. But I have my feelings, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old Reynolds house on Meridian Street has
been turned into a garage,&#8221; said Ethel; &#8220;it&#8217;s too bad
those old homes had to go. Miss Reynolds has bought
a house not far from where Bob Cummings built.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any mention of the Cummingses, no matter how
inadvertent, inevitably precipitated a discussion of
that family from some angle. Mrs. Durland said for
the hundredth time that they didn&#8217;t deserve their prosperity;
she doubted very much whether they were
happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob&#8217;s the best one of the family,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;Tom and Merwin haven&#8217;t amounted to anything and
they never will. It must have been a blow to the
family when Merwin married a girl who was nobody,
or worse. She worked in some automobile office.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel challenged the statement that the girl Merwin
Cummings married worked in an automobile office.
It was a railroad office, and though it didn&#8217;t
matter particularly with which method of transportation
the young woman was identified before her marriage,
Mrs. Durland and Ethel debated the question
for several minutes. Mrs. Durland had only heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
somewhere that Mrs. Merwin Cummings had been
a stenographer for an automobile agent while Ethel
was positive that a railroad office had been the scene
of the girl&#8217;s labors, her authority being another girl
who worked in the same place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jessie didn&#8217;t speak any too highly of her,&#8221; Ethel
added; &#8220;not that there was anything <i>really</i> wrong with
the girl. She ran around a good deal, and usually
had two or three men on the string.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many very nice girls keep two or three
men on the string,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that
there&#8217;s anything so terrible in that.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The next day at noon Grace went to a trust company
where she kept an account that represented the
aggregate of small gifts of cash she had received
through a number of years at Christmas and on her
birthdays. As she waited at the window for her passbook,
Bob Cummings crossed the lobby on his way to
the desk of one of the officers. She wondered how he
would greet her if they met, and what her attitude
toward him ought to be in view of the break between her
father and Isaac Cummings. She found a certain
mild excitement as she pondered this, her eyes occasionally
turning toward Cummings as he leaned
against the railing that enclosed the administrative
offices of the company. Grace had always liked and
admired him; and it had hurt her more than she ever
confessed that after the removal of the Cummingses
from the old neighborhood Bob had gradually ceased
his attentions. Perhaps his family had interfered as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
her mother had hinted; but it made no difference now
that he had married and passed completely out of her
ken.</p>

<p>Cummings had finished his errand and was walking
quickly toward the door when he caught sight of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Grace! I&#8217;m mighty glad to see you,&#8221; he
said cordially. &#8220;Why&mdash;&#8221; He checked himself and
the smile left his face abruptly as he remembered that
their friendly status had changed since their last
meeting.</p>

<p>Grace relieved his embarrassment promptly by
smilingly putting out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to see you, Bob,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
really been a long time, almost three years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about,&#8221; he answered slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Father Time has a way of romping right on!&#8221;
she remarked lightly.</p>

<p>They were in the path of customers intent upon
reaching the cages and she took a step toward the
door when he said, glancing toward a long bench at
the side of the room, &#8220;If you&#8217;re not in a rush let&#8217;s sit
down a minute. There&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to say to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; she assented, surprised but not
displeased.</p>

<p>He was the son of a man who had dismissed her
father from the concern in which their names had
long been identified; but in so public a place there
could be no harm in talking to him. Her old liking
for him at once outweighed any feeling she had against
his father. He was a big boy when she was still a
small girl and he was her first hero. He was always
quiet, thoughtful and studious, with a chivalrous regard
for the rights and feelings of others. They had
been chums, confiding their troubles to each other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
It was to her that he had revealed his succession of
boyish ambitions, and she had encouraged his fondness
for music when other youngsters twitted him
for taking piano lessons like a girl. He had never
thought he would like business; he wanted to be a
musician, with the leadership of an orchestra as his
ultimate goal. It was because his brother Merwin
had from an early age shown a refractory spirit that
the parental authority had thwarted Bob&#8217;s aspirations;
one of the sons at least had to go into the
business and Bob was now a vice-president of the
reorganized Cummings Manufacturing Company.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hoping for a chance to see you, Grace.
It&#8217;s not easy to speak of it but I want you to know
I&#8217;m sorry things turned out as they did. About your
father and the business, I mean. You must all of you
feel pretty hard about it. I hope it doesn&#8217;t mean any
change in your plans for finishing at the university.
I know how you&#8217;d counted on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve given it up; I&#8217;m home to stay,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;But you needn&#8217;t feel badly about it. Of course it
must have been necessary&mdash;about father and the business,
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was embarrassed by her cheerful acceptance of
the situation, and stammered, leaving one or two
sentences unfinished before he got hold of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to know I did all I could to prevent the
break. It seemed a pity after your father and mine
had been together so long. But for some time the
plant had needed an active superintendent; just trusting
the foremen of the shops wouldn&#8217;t serve any
longer, and you won&#8217;t mind my saying it but your
father never liked executive work. I suggested another
way of handling it that would have made Mr.
Durland a vice-president and free to go on with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
experiments, but I couldn&#8217;t put it through. I did my
best; honestly I did, Grace!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the old boyish eagerness in this appeal.
He regarded her fixedly, anxious for some assurance
that she understood. She understood only too well
that her father had become an encumbrance, and that
in plain terms the company couldn&#8217;t afford to keep him
at his old salary any longer. It was unnecessary for
Bob to apologize; but it was like him to seize the first
possible moment to express his sympathy. She had
always felt the gentleness in him, which was denoted
in his blue eyes, which just now shone with the reflection
of his eagerness to set himself right with her.
He turned his hat continually in his hands&mdash;they were
finely shaped, with long supple fingers. At the base of
his left thumb there was a scar, almost imperceptible,
the result of a slash with a jack knife one day in the
Durland yard where he had taken her dare to bring
down a particular fine spray of blossoms from an
old cherry tree. In his anxiety to deliver it unbroken
on the bough he had cut himself. She remembered
her consternation at seeing the injury, his swaggering
attempt to belittle it; his submission to her ministrations
as she tied it up with a handkerchief. She was
twelve then; he sixteen. He saw the direction of her
eyes, lifted the hand and with a smile glanced at the
scar. She colored as she realized that he had read
her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was centuries ago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We did use to
have good times in your back yard! Do you remember
the day you tumbled out of the swing and broke
your arm? You didn&#8217;t cry; you were a good little
sport.&#8221; And then, his eyes meeting hers, &#8220;You&#8217;re still
a mighty good sport!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I never have anything worse than a broken arm
to cry over I&#8217;ll be lucky,&#8221; she answered evasively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>There was no excuse for lingering; he had expressed
his regret at her father&#8217;s elimination from Cummings-Durland,
and it served no purpose to compare memories
of the former friendly relation between the
young people of the two families, which were now
bound to recede to the vanishing point. But he
seemed in no haste to leave her. She on her side
was finding pleasurable sensations in the encounter.
He had been her first sweetheart, so recognized by the
other youngsters of the neighborhood, and they had
gone to the same dancing class. And he had kissed
her once, shyly, on a night when the Cummingses
were giving a children&#8217;s party. This had occurred on
a dark corner of the veranda. It had never
been repeated or referred to between them, but
the memory of it was not without its sweetness. She
was ashamed of herself for remembering it now. She
wondered whether he too remembered it. And there
had been those later attentions after the Cummingses
had moved away that had encouraged hopes in her
own breast not less than in her mother&#8217;s that Bob&#8217;s
early preference might survive the shock of the
Cummingses&#8217; translation to the fashionable district, with
its inevitable change of social orientation.</p>

<p>Ethel and her mother had questioned the happiness
of his marriage, and her mind played upon this
as she sat beside him, feeling the charm he had always
had for her and wondering a little about the
girl he had married whom she had never seen and
knew of only from the talk at home. But two years
was not long enough; it was ridiculous to assume that
he wasn&#8217;t happy with his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly had a lot of fun over there,&#8221; he was
saying. &#8220;I suppose the park fountain plays just the
same and the kids still sail their boats in the pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and go wading and fall in and have to be fished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
out by the policeman! But we can&#8217;t be kids always,
Bob!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s the worst of it!&#8221; he said with a tinge of
dejection.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all grown up now and have a job. I&#8217;m a working
girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he exclaimed incredulously. &#8220;And Roy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Roy&#8217;s to finish his law course; he&#8217;ll be through
in June.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad, Grace!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It&#8217;s you
who ought to have stayed on! You&#8217;re the very type of
girl who ought to go to college. It would have made
all the difference in the world to you! And Ethel&mdash;is
she at work too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she&#8217;s in an insurance office and I&#8217;m in
Shipley&#8217;s!&#8221; she went on smiling to relieve his evident
discomfiture. &#8220;I&#8217;m in the ready-to-wear and I&#8217;ll appreciate
any customers you send my way. Call for Number
Eighteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Grace! You don&#8217;t mean it! You have no
business doing a thing like that. You could do a lot
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t just see it. I&#8217;m an unskilled laborer
and haven&#8217;t time to fit myself for teaching, stenography
or anything like that. You get results quicker
in a place like Shipley&#8217;s. That is, I hope to get them
if I&#8217;m as intelligent as I think I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry, Grace. I feel&mdash; I feel&mdash; as
though we were responsible, father and I; and we are,
of course. There ought to have been some other way
for you; something more&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t! That&#8217;s the way mother and Ethel
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose quickly, feeling that nothing was to be
gained by continuing the discussion of matters that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
were irrevocably settled. And, moreover, his distress
was so manifest in his face that she feared the scrutiny
of passers-by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Bob,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m awfully glad I
met you. Please don&#8217;t trouble at all about what can&#8217;t
be helped. I haven&#8217;t any hard feeling&mdash;not the slightest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it at all,&#8221; he said impatiently.</p>

<p>He kept beside her to the entrance, where she gave
him a nod and smile and hurried away. She was
troubled at once for fear she hadn&#8217;t expressed cordially
enough her appreciation of his sympathy. Very
likely they would never meet again; there was no
reason why they should. He had merely done what
was perfectly natural in view of their old friendship,
made it clear that he was sorry her father had been
thrust out of the company of which he had been one
of the founders. She was unable to see anything in
the interview beyond a wish on his part to be kind, to
set himself right. And it was like Bob to do that.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The strong romantic strain in her was quickened by
the meeting. All afternoon her thoughts played about
Bob Cummings. She reviewed their associations in
childhood on through those last attentions after the
Cummingses left the Military Park neighborhood.
Her mother had probably been right in saying that if
fortune hadn&#8217;t borne the Cummingses steadily upward,
leaving the Durlands behind, Bob might have married
her. It had been a mistake for him to marry a society
girl who was, she surmised, incapable of appreciating
his temperament. A matter of propinquity very
likely; she had heard that the girl was not rich but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
belonged to one of the old families; and very likely on
her side it had been an advantageous arrangement.</p>

<p>Why did men marry the wrong women? she asked
herself with proneness of youth to propound and
answer unanswerable questions. There was Trenton,
who had so frankly admitted the failure of
his own marriage and with equal frankness took the
burden of his failure upon himself. No two men could
be more utterly unlike than Ward Trenton and
Bob Cummings, and she busied herself contrasting
them. Trenton was practical-minded; Bob a dreamer,
and save for his college experiences the range of his
life had been narrow. If both were free which would
she choose? So great was her preoccupation with
these speculations that her work suffered; through
sheer inattention she let a promising customer escape
without making a purchase.</p>

<p>In the afternoon distribution of mail she received
a letter from Trenton. It began, &#8220;Dear Grace&#8221; and
read:</p>

<p>&#8220;I expected to see you again this week&mdash;that is, of
course, if you&#8217;d be willing; but I&#8217;m called to Kansas
City unexpectedly and may not touch your port for
ten days or so. I&#8217;m not conceited enough to assume
that you will be grief-stricken over my delay, and
strictly speaking there&#8217;s no excuse for writing except
that you&#8217;ve rather haunted me,&mdash;a welcome ghost, I
assure you! I talked far too much about myself the
other night. One matter I shouldn&#8217;t have spoken of at
all. No question of confidence in you or anything of
that sort. But it&#8217;s something I never discuss even
with old and intimate friends. You have guessed what
I mean. Bad taste, you probably thought it. It was
quite that! I want you to think as well of me as you
can. I&#8217;m counting very much on seeing you again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
I hope you are well and happy and that nothing has
happened to your eyes since I saw them last!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all except that he named a Kansas City
club where he could be reached for the next week if
she felt moved to write. She hadn&#8217;t expected to hear
from him and the note was a distinct surprise. At
every opportunity she reread it, and, catching her in
the act, Irene teased her about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve started something! I&#8217;ll wager he
signed his name in full; that&#8217;s just like him. Tommy
never writes to me and when he wires he signs an
assumed name. But Ward Trenton&#8217;s different. I
think if he decided to commit murder he&#8217;d send his
own account of it to the papers. He didn&#8217;t talk to
you about his wife, I suppose, when Tommy and I
left you alone so long at The Shack? Tommy&#8217;s known
him for years but he says he wouldn&#8217;t think of
mentioning his wife to him. I&#8217;d like to see Ward in love!
These quiet ones go strong when they get started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, his letter&#8217;s just a little friendly jolly. He&#8217;s had
to go to Kansas City instead of coming back here
right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he just had to explain that!&#8221; Irene
laughed. &#8220;I can see this is going to be a real case.
See what you can do with that woman just coming in.
She looks as though she might really have some of
the mazuma.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not so easy as Grace had imagined in her
spiritual ardor of Sunday to begin retreating from
Irene. She realized that Irene would hardly listen in
an amiable spirit to the warning she had thought in her
hours of contrition it was her duty to give her friend.
Irene&#8217;s serenity as she paced the aisles of the department,
her friendliness and unfailing good humor were
all disarming. Irene wasn&#8217;t so bad perhaps; Grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
was much more tolerant of Irene than she had thought
on Sunday would ever be possible again.</p>

<p>The letter from Ward Trenton had the effect of
reopening a door which Grace had believed closed and
the key thrown away. She found herself wondering
whether he might not always write to girls he met
and liked; and yet as his image appeared before her&mdash;and
he lived vividly in her thoughts&mdash;she accepted as
sincere his statement that he had broken an established
reserve in talking of his wife. This of course
was what he referred to; and she saw a fine nobility
in his apprehension lest the recipient of his confidences
might think the less of him for mentioning his wife
at all.</p>

<p>Grace was again tormented by curiosity as to
whether Trenton still loved his wife and the hope that
he did not. She hated herself for this; hated herself
for having lost her grip upon the good resolutions of
Sunday to forget the whole episode of Kemp&#8217;s party.
She knew enough of the mind&#8217;s processes to indulge
in what she fancied was a rigid self-analysis. She
wondered whether she was really a normal being,
whether other girls&#8217; thoughts ran riot about men as
hers did; whether there might not be something vulgar
and base in her nature that caused her within a few
hours to tolerate the thought of two men, both married,
as potential lovers....</p>

<p>It occurred to her that she might too effectually
have burned her bridges when she left the university.
There were young men she had known during her two
years in Bloomington whose interest she might have
kept alive; among them there were a number of sons
of well-to-do families in country towns. But she was
unable to visualize herself married and settled in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
small town with her prospect of seeing and knowing
the world limited by a husband&#8217;s means or ambition.
There were one or two young professors who had paid
her attentions. One of them, a widower and a man
of substantial attainments, had asked her to marry
him, but she was unable to see herself a professor&#8217;s
wife, beset by all the uncertainties of the teaching
profession.</p>

<p>She had always been used to admiration, but until
now she had heavily discounted all the compliments
that were paid her good looks. She found herself
covertly looking into the mirrors as she passed.
Trenton had been all over the world and no
doubt had seen many beautiful women; and yet he
wrote that she haunted him, which could only mean
that he was unable to escape from the thought of her.
Again, deeply humble, she scouted the idea that he
could have fallen in love with her; he was only a little
sorry for her, thinking of her probably as a rather
nice girl who was to be pitied because she had to
work for her living.</p>

<p>He had spoken of being lonely. Maybe it was only
for lack of anything better to do that he fell to thinking
of her as he sat in the club in St. Louis and wrote
to her out of his craving for sympathy. At twenty-one
Grace did not know that the only being in the
world who is more dangerous than a lonely woman
is a lonely man.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Grace was correct in her assumption that Ward
Trenton had written her in a fit of loneliness but she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
did not know that in the same hour he had written
also to his wife. After a few sentences explaining his
presence in St. Louis, the letter to Mrs. Trenton ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost ridiculous,&mdash;the distinctly separate lives
we lead. I was just studying the calendar and find
that we haven&#8217;t met for exactly six months. When
I&#8217;m at home&mdash;if I may so refer to the house in Pittsburgh
that fixes my voting place and&mdash;pardon me!&mdash;doesn&#8217;t
fix much of anything else&mdash;I occasionally find
traces of your visits. I must say the servants do
pretty well considering that they go their own gait.
You&#8217;re a wonderful housekeeper at long range! But
I&#8217;m not kicking. The gods must have their will with
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I read of you in the newspapers frequently and
judge that you&#8217;re living the life that suits you best.
I found a copy of your &#8216;Clues to a New Social Order&#8217;
on the new book table here in the club library and reread
parts of it. It never ceases to tickle me that a
woman of your upbringing, with your line of blue-nosed
New England ancestors, should want to pull
down the pillars of society. I marvel at you!...</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve asked me now and then not to be afraid
to tell you if ever I ran into a woman who interested
me particularly. I haven&#8217;t had anything to report till
now. But the other night I met a girl,&mdash;she&#8217;s probably
just crossing the line into the twenties,&mdash;an
interesting, provocative young person. She represents
in a mild degree the new order of things you&#8217;re so
mad about; going to live her own life; marriage not
in the sketch. She&#8217;s a salesgirl in a big shop, but
her people have known better days and she went half-way
through college. She&#8217;s standing with reluctant
feet where the brook and river meet, but I&#8217;m afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
won&#8217;t be satisfied to play in the brook; she&#8217;s keen for
the deeper waters. She&#8217;s as handsome as a goddess.
She kissed me very prettily&mdash;her own idea I assure
you! The remembrance of this incident is not wholly
displeasing to me; it was quite spontaneous; filial
perhaps....</p>

<p>&#8220;Those bonds you have in the Ashawana Water
Power Company are all right. I had a look at the
plant recently and the dividends are sure....&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Having sealed and addressed the envelopes Trenton
laid them side by side on the blotter before him,
lighted a cigarette, and then drew out and opened the
locket that Grace had noted at The Shack, studying
the woman&#8217;s face within a little wistfully. Then with
a sigh he thrust it into his pocket and went out into
the night and tramped the streets, coming at last to
the post office where he mailed both letters.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Grace set off with the liveliest expectations to keep
her appointment with Miss Reynolds. The house
struck her at once as a true expression of the taste
and characteristics of its owner. It was severely
simple in design and furnishing, but with adequate
provision for comfort. Grace had seen pictures of
such rooms in magazines and knew that they represented
the newest ideas in house decoration. The
neutral tint of the walls was an ease to eye and spirit.
Ethel had spoken of Miss Reynolds as quaint, an
absurd term to apply either to the little woman or any
of her belongings. She was very much up to date,
even a little ahead of the procession, it seemed to
Grace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Oh, thank you! I&#8217;m glad if it seems nice,&#8221; Miss
Reynolds replied when Grace praised the house. &#8220;All
my life I&#8217;ve lived in houses where everything was old
and the furniture so heavy you had to get a derrick
to move it on cleaning day. But I can&#8217;t accept praise
for anything here. The house was built for a family
that moved away from town without occupying it.
The young architect who designed it had ideas about
how it ought to be fixed up and I turned him loose.
There was a music room, so I had to get a grand piano
to fit into the alcove made for it. That young man is
most advanced and I thought at first he wouldn&#8217;t let
me have any place to sit down but you see he did allow
me a few chairs! Are you freezing? I hate an over-heated
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly comfortable,&#8221; said Grace, noting
that Miss Reynolds wore the skirt of the blue suit
she had sold her, with a plain white waist and a loose
collar. Her snow white hair was brushed back loosely
from her forehead. Her head was finely modeled and
her face, aglow from an afternoon tramp in the November
air, still preserved the roundness of youth.
The wrinkles perceptible about her eyes and mouth
seemed out of place,&mdash;only tentative tracings, not the
indelible markings of age. She had an odd little way
of turning her head to one side when listening, and
mistaking this for a sign of deafness Grace had lifted
her voice slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear child!&#8221; cried Miss Reynolds, &#8220;just
because I cock my head like a robin don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m
shy of hearing. It always amuses me to have people
take it for granted that I can&#8217;t hear. I hear everything;
I sometimes wish I didn&#8217;t hear so much! I&#8217;ve
always had that trick. It&#8217;s because one of my eyes is
a bit stronger than the other. You&#8217;ll find that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
don&#8217;t do it when I wear my glasses, but I usually take
them off in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the table Miss Reynolds rambled on as though
Grace were an old friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our old house down on Meridian Street was sold
while I was abroad. It had grown to be a dingy hole.
Garret full of trunks of letters and rubbish like that.
I cabled at once to sell or destroy everything in the
place. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m able to have a new deal.
Are you crazy about old furniture? Please tell me
you are not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I like new things ever so much better!&#8221; Grace
assured her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you would. I despise old furniture. Old
stuff of every kind. Old people too!&#8221; With a smile
on her lips she watched Grace to note the effect of
this speech. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have dreamed of asking you
to give up an evening for me if I meant to talk to you
like an old woman. My neighbors are mostly young
married people, but they don&#8217;t seem to mind my settling
among them. I&#8217;m sixty-two; hurry and say I
don&#8217;t look a day over fifty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty!&#8221; Grace corrected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew I was going to like you! I think I&#8217;ll
spend my remaining years here if I can keep away
from people who want to talk about old times, meaning
of course when I was a girl. It doesn&#8217;t thrill me
at all to know that right here where this house stands
my grandfather owned a farm. Every time I go
down town I dodge old citizens I&#8217;ve known all my
life for fear they&#8217;ll tell me about the great changes
and expect me to get tearful about it. I can&#8217;t mourn
over the passing of old landmarks and I&#8217;d certainly not
weep at the removal of some of the old fossils around
this town who count all their money every day to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
make sure nobody&#8217;s got a nickel away from them.
They keep their lawyers busy tightening up their
wills. They&#8217;ve invented ways of tying up property in
trusts so you can almost take it with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s their way of enjoying life, I suppose,&#8221; remarked
Grace, who was taking advantage of Miss
Reynolds&#8217; talkativeness to do full justice to a substantial
dinner. The filet of beef and the fresh mushrooms
testified to the presence of an artist in the
kitchen, and the hot rolls were of superlative lightness.
Miss Reynolds paused occasionally to urge
Grace to a second helping of everything offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I detest anemic people,&#8221; Miss Reynolds declared.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t eat my food I&#8217;ll feel terribly guilty at
asking you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best food I ever ate! We were going to
have corned beef and cabbage at home, so all these
wonderful dishes seem heavenly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve probably wondered why I grabbed you as
I did and asked you to sit at meat with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I hope you asked me because you liked me!&#8221;
Grace answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the correct answer, Grace&mdash;may I call you
Grace? I hate having a lot of people around; I like
to concentrate on one person, and when I met you in
the church entry it just popped into my head that
you wouldn&#8217;t mind a bit giving me an evening. It&#8217;s
awfully tiresome going to dinners where the people
are all my own age. I&#8217;ve always hated formal entertaining.
You struck me as a very fair representative
of the new generation that appeals to me so
much. Don&#8217;t look so startled; I mean that, my dear,
as a compliment! And of course I really don&#8217;t know
a thing about you except that you have very pretty
manners and didn&#8217;t get vexed that day in the store<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
when I must have frightened you out of your wits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Grace protested. &#8220;I liked your
way of saying exactly what you wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always try to do that; it saves a lot of bother.
And please don&#8217;t be offended if I say that it&#8217;s a joy
to see you sitting right there looking so charming.
You have charming ways; of course you know that.
And the effect is much enhanced when you blush that
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was very charming indeed as she smiled at
her singular hostess, who had a distinct charm of her
own. She felt that she could say anything to Miss
Reynolds and with girlish enthusiasm she promptly
told her that she was adorable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been called a crank by experts,&#8221; Miss Reynolds
said challengingly, as though she were daring her
guest to refute the statement. &#8220;I get along better
with foreigners than with my own people. Over there
they attribute my idiosyncrasies to American crudeness,
to be tolerated only because they think me much
better off in worldly goods than I really am.&#8221;</p>

<p>They remained at the table for coffee, and the waitress
who had served the dinner offered cigarettes.
Grace shook her head and experienced a mild shock
when Miss Reynolds took a cigarette and lighted it
with the greatest unconcern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abominable habit! Got in the way of it while I
was abroad. Please don&#8217;t let me corrupt you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll learn in time,&#8221; Grace replied, amused
as she remembered the stress her mother and Ethel
had laid on Miss Reynolds&#8217; conservatism.</p>

<p>It occurred to her that Miss Reynolds was entitled
to know something of her history and she recited the
facts of her life simply and straightforwardly. She
had only said that her father had been unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
without explaining his connection with Cummings-Durland.
Miss Reynolds smoked and sipped her
coffee in silence; then asked in her quick fashion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cummings-Durland? Those names tinkle together
away back in my memory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father and Mr. Cummings came here from
Rangerton and began business together. The Cummingses
used to live neighbors to us over by Military
Park.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob Cummings is one of my neighbors,&#8221; said Miss
Reynolds. &#8220;Rather tragic&mdash;putting that young man
into business. He hates it. There ought to be some
way of protecting artistic young men from fathers
who try to fit square pegs into round holes. I suppose
the business troubles broke up the friendship of your
families.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; my mother and sister are very bitter about
it; they think father was unfairly treated. But I met
Bob only this morning and he was very friendly. He
seemed terribly cut up because I&#8217;d left college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a sensitive fellow; he would feel it,&#8221; said
Miss Reynolds. &#8220;So you children grew up together&mdash;the
Durlands and the Cummings. I&#8217;m asking about
your present relations because Bob comes in occasionally
to play my piano&mdash;when there&#8217;s something
on at his own house that he doesn&#8217;t like. His wife&#8217;s
the sort that just can&#8217;t be quiet; must have people
around. She&#8217;s crazy about bridge and he isn&#8217;t! He
called me on the telephone just before you came to ask
if he might come over after dinner, as his wife&#8217;s having
people in for bridge. I told him to come along. I
enjoy his playing; he really plays very well indeed.
You don&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Grace, wondering at the fate that
was throwing her in Bob Cummings&#8217; way twice in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
day and a day in which she had been torn with so
many conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have the slightest feeling about meeting him
do say so; you may always be perfectly frank with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; thank you, Miss Reynolds. But I&#8217;d love
to hear Bob play.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were again in the living room Grace
stood for a moment scanning a table covered with
periodicals and new books.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I came home I&#8217;ve been trying to find out
what&#8217;s going on in America, so I read everything,&#8221;
Miss Reynolds explained. &#8220;The general opinion
seems to be that things are going to pot. Right under
your hand there&#8217;s a book called &#8216;Clues to a New
Social Order,&#8217; written by a woman named Trenton.
I understand she&#8217;s a respectable person and not a
short-haired lunatic; but she throws everything overboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read it,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly revolutionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of that!&#8221; Miss Reynolds retorted. &#8220;But it
does make you think! Everybody&#8217;s restless and crazy
for excitement. My young married neighbors all belong
to families I know or know about; live in very
charming houses and have money to spend&mdash;too much
most of them&mdash;and they don&#8217;t seem able to stand an
evening at home by themselves. But maybe the new
way&#8217;s better. Maybe their chances of happiness are
greater where they mix around more. I&#8217;m curious
about the whole business. These young folks don&#8217;t
go to church. Why don&#8217;t they, when their fathers
and grandfathers always did? Their parents stayed
at home in the evening. My father used to grumble
horribly when my mother tried to get him into a dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
suit. But there was wickedness then too, only people
just whispered about it and tried to keep it from the
young folks. There were men right here in this town
who sat up very proper in the churches on Sunday
who didn&#8217;t hesitate to break all the commandments
during the week. But now you might think people
were sending up fireworks to call attention to their
sins! I remember the first time I went to a dinner&mdash;that
was thirty years ago&mdash;where cocktails were
passed around. It seemed awful&mdash;the very end of
the world. When I told my mother about it she was
horrified; said what she thought of the hostess who
had exposed her daughter to temptation! But now
prohibition&#8217;s driven everybody to drink. I asked my
chauffeur yesterday how long it would take him to
get me a quart of whiskey and he said about half an
hour if I&#8217;d let him use the car. I told him to go ahead
and sure enough he was back with it in twenty minutes.
It was pretty fair whiskey, too,&#8221; Miss Reynolds
concluded. &#8220;I was curious to see just how it felt to
break the law and I confess to you, my dear, that I
experienced a feeling of exultation!&#8221;</p>

<p>She reached for a fresh cigarette and lighted it
tranquilly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s down on the young people,&#8221; said
Grace, confident that she had a sympathetic listener.
&#8220;They tell us all the time that we&#8217;re of no account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are pages of that on that table,&#8221; Miss Reynolds
replied. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m for the young people; particularly
you girls who have to rustle for yourselves.
If I stood up in a store all day or hammered a typewriter
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d feel that I was entitled to some
pleasure when I got through. Just what do girls do&mdash;I
don&#8217;t mean girls of your upbringing exactly and your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
schooling,&mdash;but less lucky girls who manage their own
affairs and are not responsible to any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been at work long enough to know much
about that,&#8221; said Grace; &#8220;but&mdash;nearly every girl who&#8217;s
at all attractive has a beau!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; Miss Reynolds affirmed promptly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s always been so. There&#8217;s nothing new in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they go to dances. Every girl likes to dance.
And sometimes they&#8217;re taken out to dinner or to a
show if the young man can afford it. Girls don&#8217;t have
parties at home very much; I mean even where they
live at home. There&#8217;s not room to dance usually; the
houses are too small and it isn&#8217;t much fun. And if
the beau has a car he takes the girl driving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And these girls marry and have homes of their
own? That still happens, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a good many girls don&#8217;t want to marry,&mdash;not
the young men they&#8217;re likely to meet. Or if they
do, some of them keep on working. There are girls
in Shipley&#8217;s who are married and keep their jobs.
They like the additional money; they can wear better
clothes, and they like to keep their independence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are!&#8221; Miss Reynolds exclaimed. &#8220;The
old stuff about woman&#8217;s place being in the home isn&#8217;t
the final answer any more. If you won&#8217;t think it impertinent
just how do you feel on that point, Grace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shouldn&#8217;t want to marry for a long, long
time!&mdash;even if I had the chance,&#8221; Grace answered
with the candor Miss Reynolds invited. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got that
idea about freedom and independence myself! I hope
I&#8217;m not shocking you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite the contrary. I had chances to marry myself,&#8221;
Miss Reynolds confessed. &#8220;I almost did marry
when I was twenty-two but decided I didn&#8217;t love the
young man enough. I had these ideas of freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
too, you see. I haven&#8217;t really been very sorry; I suppose
I ought to be ashamed of myself. But the man
I almost married died miserably, an awful failure.
I have nothing to regret. How about college girls&mdash;you
must know a good many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a good many co-eds marry as soon as they
graduate, and settle down. But those I&#8217;ve known are
mostly country town girls. I think it&#8217;s different with
city girls who have to go to work. They&#8217;re not so
anxious to get married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact seems to be that marriage isn&#8217;t just the
chief goal of a woman&#8217;s life any more. Things have
reached such a pass that it&#8217;s really respectable to be a
spinster like me! But we all like to be loved&mdash;we
women, don&#8217;t we? And it&#8217;s woman&#8217;s blessing and her
curse that she has love to give!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, then bent forward and
touched Grace&#8217;s hand. There was a mist of dreams
in the girl&#8217;s lovely eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish every happiness for you, dear. I hope with
all my heart that love will come to you in a great way,
which is the only way that counts!&#8221;</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>A moment later Bob Cummings appeared and
greeted Grace with unfeigned surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say we don&#8217;t need to be introduced! Grace
and I are old friends,&#8221; he said, still unable to conceal
his mystification at finding Grace established on terms
of intimacy in his neighbor&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I inveigled Grace here without telling her it was to
be a musical evening,&#8221; said Miss Reynolds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d have come just the same!&#8221; laughed Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cut the music now,&#8221; said Cummings. &#8220;It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
will be a lot more fun to talk. I tell you, Grace, it&#8217;s
a joy to have a place of refuge like this! Miss Reynolds
is the kindest woman in the world. I&#8217;ve adopted
her as my aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed to Miss Reynolds, and glanced from one
to the other with boyish eagerness for their approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the first I&#8217;ve heard of it,&#8221; Miss Reynolds
retorted with a grieved air. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell him,
Grace, that being an aunt sounds too old. You might
both adopt me as a cousin!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace and Bob discussed the matter with mock
gravity and decided that there was no good reason
why they shouldn&#8217;t be her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must call me Cousin Beulah!&#8221; said Miss
Reynolds. Her nephews and nieces were widely scattered
she said, and she didn&#8217;t care for her lawful
cousins.</p>

<p>Grace talked much more freely under the stimulus
of Bob&#8217;s presence. It appeared that Miss Reynolds
had not known Bob until she moved into the neighborhood
and their acquaintance had begun quite romantically.
Miss Reynolds had stopped him as he
was passing her house shortly after she moved in and
asked him whether he knew anything about trees.
Some of the trees on her premises were preyed upon
by malevolent insects and quite characteristically she
had halted him to ask whether he could recommend
a good tree doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You looked intelligent; so I took a chance,&#8221; Miss
Reynolds explained. &#8220;And the man you recommended
didn&#8217;t hurt the trees much&mdash;only two died.
I&#8217;ve bought a tree book and hereafter I&#8217;ll do my own
spraying.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Miss Reynolds spoke of Mrs. Cummings she
referred to her as Evelyn, explaining to Grace that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
she was the daughter of an old friend. Evelyn, it
appeared, was arranging a Thanksgiving party for one
of the country clubs. Bob said she was giving a lot
of time to it; it was going to be a brilliant affair.
Then finding that Grace did not know Evelyn and
remembering that in all likelihood her guest wouldn&#8217;t
be invited to the entertainment, Miss Reynolds turned
the talk into other channels. It was evident that Bob
was a welcome visitor to Miss Reynolds&#8217;s house and
that she understood and humored him and indulged
and encouraged his chaffing attitude toward her. That
he should make a practice of escaping from a company
at home that did not interest him was just like
Bob! He was lucky to have a neighbor so understanding
and amiable as Miss Reynolds. Perhaps again and
often she would meet Bob at Miss Reynolds&#8217;s when he
found Evelyn irksome. Grace rose and changed her
seat, as though by so doing she were escaping from
an idea she felt to be base, an affront to Miss Reynolds,
an insult to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;The piano&#8217;s waiting, Bob&#8221;; and Miss Reynolds led
the way to the music room across the hall.</p>

<p>Bob began, as had always been his way, Grace remembered,
by improvising, weaving together snatches
of classical compositions, with whimsical variations.
Then, after a pause, he sat erect, struck into Schumann&#8217;s
Nachtstuck, and followed it with Handel&#8217;s
Largo and Rubenstein&#8217;s Melody in F, all associated
in her memory with the days of their boy-and-girl
companionship. He shook his head impatiently, waited
a moment and then a new mood laying hold of him he
had recourse to Chopin, and played a succession of
pieces that filled the room with color and light. Grace
watched the sure touch of his hands, marveling that he
had been so faithful to the music that was his passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
as a boy. It had always been his solace in the unhappy
hours to which he had been a prey as far back
as she could remember. There was no questioning his
joy in the great harmonies. He was endowed with a
talent that had been cultivated with devotion, and he
might have had a brilliant career if fate had not
swept him into a business for which his temperament
wholly unfitted him.</p>

<p>While he was still playing Miss Reynolds was called
away by callers and left the room quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Bob stay here,&#8221; she whispered to Grace.
&#8220;These are people I have to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Bob ended with a Chopin valse, graceful
and capricious, that seemed to Grace to bring the joy
of spring into the room, he swung round, noted Miss
Reynolds&#8217;s absence and then the closed door.</p>

<p>&#8220;My audience reduced one-half!&#8221; he exclaimed
ruefully. &#8220;At this rate I&#8217;ll soon be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop! Those last things were marvelous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just one more! Do you remember how I cornered
you one day in our old house&mdash;you were still wearing
pigtails&mdash;and told you I&#8217;d learned a new piece and
you sat like a dear angel while I played this&mdash;my first
show piece?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Mendelssohn&#8217;s Spring Song, and she thrilled
to think that he hadn&#8217;t forgotten. The familiar chords
brought back vividly the old times; he had been so
proud and happy that day in displaying his prowess.</p>

<p>Her praise was sweet to him then, and she saw that
it was grateful to him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;You play wonderfully, Bob; it&#8217;s a pity you couldn&#8217;t
have kept on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do as we please in this world,&#8221; he said,
throwing himself into a chair and reaching for the
cigarettes. &#8220;But I get a lot of fun out of my music.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
I&#8217;m not sorry I stuck to it as I did from the time I
could stretch an octave. Are you spending the night
with Miss Reynolds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we&#8217;re not quite that chummy. Miss Reynolds
said she&#8217;d send me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life she won&#8217;t! I&#8217;m going to run you
out in my roadster. That&#8217;s settled. I don&#8217;t have to
show up at home till midnight, so there&#8217;s plenty of
time. You and Cousin Beulah seem to get on
famously.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace gave a vivacious account of the beginning of
her acquaintance with Miss Reynolds, not omitting
the ten dollar tip.</p>

<p>He laughed; then frowned darkly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been troubled about this thing ever since I
met you today,&#8221; he said doggedly; &#8220;your having to
quit college, I mean. I feel guilty, terribly guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Bob! don&#8217;t spoil my nice evening by mentioning
those things again. I know it wasn&#8217;t your
fault. So let&#8217;s go on being friends just as though
nothing had happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. But it&#8217;s rotten just the same. You
can hardly see me without&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her hand warningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob, I&#8217;d be ashamed if anything could spoil our
friendship. I&#8217;m perfectly satisfied that you had nothing
to do with father&#8217;s troubles. So please forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She won him back to good nature&mdash;she had always
been able to do that&mdash;and they talked of old times, of
the companions of their youth in the park neighborhood.
This was safe ground. The fact that they were
harking back to their childhood and youth emphasized
the changed circumstances of both the Durlands and
the Cummingses. It didn&#8217;t seem possible that he was
married; it struck her suddenly that he didn&#8217;t appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
at all married; and with this came the reflection that
he was the kind of man who should never marry. He
should have kept himself free; he had too much
temperament for a harmonious married life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know Evelyn,&#8221; he remarked a little
absently. And then as though Grace&#8217;s not knowing
Evelyn called for an explanation he added: &#8220;She was
away at school for a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s she like, Bob?&#8221; Grace asked. &#8220;A man
ought to be able to draw a wonderful picture of his
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should indeed! Let me see. She&#8217;s fair; blue
eyes; tall, slender; likes to have something doing;
wins golf cups; a splendid dancer.... Oh,
pshaw! You wouldn&#8217;t get any idea from that!&#8221; he
said with an uneasy laugh. &#8220;She&#8217;s very popular; people
like her tremendously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s lovely, Bob. Is she musical?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she doesn&#8217;t care much for music; my practicing
bores her. She used to sing a little but she&#8217;s given
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hadn&#8217;t said that he hoped she might meet
Evelyn; and for a moment Grace resented this. She
was a saleswoman in a department store and Evelyn
had no time for an old friend of her husband who
sold ready-to-wear clothing. A snob, no doubt, self-centered
and selfish; Bob&#8217;s failure to suggest a meeting
with his wife made it clear that he realized the
futility of trying to bring them together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t missed me a bit!&#8221; cried Miss Reynolds
appearing suddenly. &#8220;Is the music all over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve been reminiscing,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;And
you missed the best of Bob&#8217;s playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry those people chose tonight for their call.
It was Judge Sanders, my lawyer, and his wife, old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
friends&mdash;but I didn&#8217;t dare smoke before <i>them</i>!
You&#8217;ve got to stay now while I have a cigarette.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Grace said presently that she must go and
Miss Reynolds reached for the bell to ring for her car,
Bob stayed her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all fixed! I&#8217;ll run around and bring my
car and <i>I&#8217;ll</i> take Grace home. Please say you don&#8217;t
mind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t mind; but you needn&#8217;t think
you&#8217;re establishing a precedent. The next time Grace
comes I&#8217;ll lock the door against you and all the rest
of the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>While Bob went for his car Miss Reynolds warned
Grace that she was likely to ask her to the house again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be doing me a favor by coming, dear. And
remember, if there&#8217;s ever anything I can do for you
you&#8217;re to tell me. That&#8217;s a promise. I should be
sorry if you didn&#8217;t feel that you could come to me with
<i>anything</i>.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a little after ten,&#8221; said Bob as he started
the car, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going to touch the edge of the country
before I take you home. Is that all right? How
long&#8217;s it been since we went driving together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Centuries! It was just after you moved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid you&#8217;d forgotten. I remember the evening
perfectly. We stopped at the Country Club to
dance and just played around by ourselves. But we
did have a good time!&#8221;</p>

<p>His spirits were soaring; through his talk ran an
undercurrent of mischievous delight in his freedom.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just bully to see you again!&#8221; he repeated several
times. &#8220;While I was playing I kept thinking of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
royal fun we used to have. Do you remember that day
our families had a picnic&mdash;we were just kids then&mdash;and
you and I wandered away and got lost looking
for wild flowers or whatever the excuse was; and a
big storm came up and our mothers gave us a good
raking when we came back all soaked and everybody
was scared for fear we&#8217;d tumbled into the river!&#8221;</p>

<p>To Grace the remembrance of this adventure was
not nearly so thrilling as the fact that Bob, now married,
still chortled over the recollection and was obviously
delighted to be spending an evening with her
while his wife enjoyed herself in her own fashion at
home. He would probably not tell Evelyn that he had
taken the daughter of his father&#8217;s old business associate
driving, a girl who clerked in a department store
and was clearly out of his social orbit. Here was another
episode which Grace knew she dared not mention
at home; Ethel and her mother would be horrified.
But Grace was happy in the thought that Bob Cummings
still found pleasure in her company even if she
was Number Eighteen at Shipley&#8217;s and took and accepted
tips from kindly-disposed customers. He
halted the car at a point which afforded a broad sweep
of moonlit field and woodland.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Grace, sometimes I&#8217;ve been hungry
and positively homesick for a talk with you such as
we&#8217;ve had tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please drive on! You mustn&#8217;t say things like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the way I feel anyhow. It&#8217;s queer
how I haven&#8217;t been able to do anything I wanted to
with my life. I&#8217;m like a man who&#8217;s been pushed on a
train he didn&#8217;t want to take and can&#8217;t get off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here again was his old eager appeal for sympathy.
He was weak, she knew, with the weakness that is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
defect of such natures. It would be perfectly easy
to begin a flirtation with him, possibly to see him
frequently in some such way as she saw him now. It
was wrong to encourage him, but her curiosity as to
how far he would go overcame her scruples; it would
do no harm to lead him on a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to be very happy, Bob. You have
everything to make you happy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made mistakes all down the line,&#8221; he answered
with a flare of defiance. &#8220;I ought to have
stood out against father when he put me into the
business. I&#8217;m no good at it. But Merwin made a
mess of things; father&#8217;s got him on a ranch out in
Montana now, and Tom&#8217;s got the bug to be a doctor
and nothing can shake him. So I have to sit at a desk
every day doing things I hate and doing them badly
of course. And for the rest of it&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped short of the rest of it, which Grace
surmised was his marriage to Evelyn. It was his
own fault that he had failed to control and manage
his life. He might have resisted his father when
it came to going into business and certainly it spoke
for a feeble will if he had married to gratify his
mother&#8217;s social ambitions. She was about to bid him
drive on when he turned toward her saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel nearer to you, Grace, than to anybody else
in the world! It was always that way. It&#8217;s got hold
of me again tonight&mdash;that feeling I used to have that
no matter what happened you&#8217;d know, you&#8217;d understand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those days are gone, Bob,&#8221; she said, allowing a
vague wistfulness to creep into her tone. &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t
see you any more. We&#8217;ve both got our lives to live.
You know that as well as I do. You&#8217;re just a little
down tonight; you always had moods like this when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
you thought the world was against you. It&#8217;s just a
mood and everything will look differently tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to see you, Grace; not often maybe,
but now and then. There&#8217;ll be some way of managing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she exclaimed, her curiosity fully satisfied as
to how far he would go. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be angry with you in a
minute! This is positively the last time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
offend you for anything in the world, Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you wouldn&#8217;t, Bob,&#8221; she said kindly. &#8220;But
there are some things that won&#8217;t do, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he conceded with the petulance of
a child reluctantly admitting a fault.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you still like me, but you know perfectly
well this kind of thing&#8217;s all wrong. I mustn&#8217;t
see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Grace, what if I just have to see you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be so silly! You&#8217;ll never just have to.
You&#8217;ve got a wife to tell your troubles to.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wasn&#8217;t sure that she wanted to make it impossible
for him to see her again or that she really
preferred that he tell his troubles to his wife. His
troubles were always largely imaginary, due to his
sensitive and impressionable nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t remind me of that!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, start the car! Let&#8217;s all be cheerful! We might
as well laugh as cry in this world. Did you see the
game Saturday? I had a suitor turn up from the university
and we had a jolly time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221; Bob demanded savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob, you&#8217;re a perfect scream! Well, you
needn&#8217;t be jealous of <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m jealous of every man you know!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you&#8217;re talking like a crazy man! Suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
I were to tell you I&#8217;m jealous of Evelyn! Please remember
that you forgot all about me and married another
girl quite cheerfully with a church wedding and
flowers and everything. You needn&#8217;t come to me
now for consolation!&#8221;</p>

<p>She refused to hear his defense from this charge,
and mocked him by singing snatches of college songs
till they were in town. When they reached the Durland
house she told him not to get out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell the family you brought me home;
they wouldn&#8217;t understand. Thanks ever so much,
Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland and Ethel were waiting to hear of her
evening with Miss Reynolds and she told everything
except that she had met Cummings there. She satisfied
as quickly as possible their curiosity as to Miss
Reynolds and her establishment, and hurried to her
room eager to be alone. She assured herself that she
could never love Bob Cummings, would never have
loved him even if their families had remained neighbors
and it had been possible to marry him. He wasn&#8217;t
her type&mdash;the phrase pleased her&mdash;and in trying to determine
just what type of man most appealed to her
Trenton loomed large in her speculations. Within a
few weeks she had encountered two concrete instances
of the instability of marriage. Love, it seemed, was
a fleeting thing and loyalty had become a by-word.
Bob was only a spoiled boy, shallow, easily influenced,
yet withal endowed with graces and charms. But
graces and charms were not enough. She brought herself
to the point of feeling sorry for Evelyn, who probably
refused to humor and pet Bob and was doubtless
grateful that he had music as an outlet for his
emotions. It was something, though, to have found
that he hadn&#8217;t forgotten; that there were times when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
he felt the need of her. She wondered whether he
would take her word as final and make no further
attempt to see her.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Grace addressed herself sincerely to the business
of bringing all the cheer possible to the home circle.
She overcame her annoyance at being obliged to recount
the details of her work, realizing that her
mother spent her days at home and save for the small
affairs of her club had little touch with the world
beyond her dooryard. Ethel&#8217;s days in the insurance
office were much alike and she lacked Grace&#8217;s gift
for making a good story out of a trifling incident.
Even Mr. Durland enjoyed Grace&#8217;s account of the
whims and foibles of the women she encountered at
Shipley&#8217;s. Grace reasoned that so long as she lived
at home it would be a mistake not to make the best
of things; but even in her fits of repentance she had
not regretted her assertion of the right to go and come
unquestioned.</p>

<p>In the week following she left the house on two
evenings saying merely that she was going out. On
one of these occasions she returned a book to the public
library; on another she walked aimlessly for an
hour. These unexplained absences were to determine
whether her new won liberty was really firmly established.
Nothing was said either by her mother or
Ethel, though it was clear that they were mystified by
her early return, though not to the point of asking
where she had been. On a third evening she announced
at the table that she had earned a good bonus
that day and would celebrate by taking them all to
the vaudeville. Mrs. Durland and Ethel gave plausible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
excuses for declining, but not without expressing
their appreciation of the invitation in kind terms,
and Grace and her father set off alone.</p>

<p>In her cogitations Grace was convinced that nothing
short of a miracle could ever improve materially
the family fortunes. They had the house free of
encumbrance, but it needed re-roofing, and the furnishings
were old and dingy. Mrs. Durland had
worked out a budget by which to manage the family
finances, and it was clear enough to Grace that what
she and Ethel earned would just about take care of
the necessary running expenses. Mrs. Durland had
received for many years an income of five hundred
dollars a year from her father&#8217;s estate, and this Grace
learned had always been spent on the family. The
last payment had been put away, Mrs. Durland explained
to her daughters, to help establish Roy after
he completed his law course. It was impressed upon
Grace constantly that all the hopes of bettering the
family conditions centered in Roy. Ethel shared,
though in less degree, her mother&#8217;s confidence in the
son of the house. Grace kept silent when Roy&#8217;s prospects
were discussed, feeling that it would serve no
purpose to express her feeling that Roy had no special
talent for the law, and even if he had the Durlands
were without family or business connections
that could possibly assist him in establishing himself.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Grace&#8217;s meeting with Bob Cummings served to
sharpen her sense of social differentiations. Her
mother had always encouraged the idea that the Durlands
were a family of dignity, entitled to the highest
consideration; but stranded as they were in a neighborhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
that had no lines of communication with
polite society, Mrs. Durland now rarely received an
invitation even to the houses of her old friends.
Grace&#8217;s excursions in social science had made her
aware of the existence of such a thing as class consciousness;
but she had never questioned that she
belonged to the favored element. The thought assailed
her now that as a wage-earning girl she had
a fixed social status from which there was little likelihood
she would ever escape. The daughters of
prominent families she waited on at Shipley&#8217;s were
no better looking, no more intelligent and had no
better social instincts than she possessed; but she was
as completely shut off from any contact with them
as though she were the child of a Congo chieftain.
With all her romanticism she failed to picture the son
of one of the first families making her acquaintance
and introducing her to his family as the girl he meant
to marry. Several young men with whom she became
acquainted in Shipley&#8217;s had asked her to go to dances,
or for Sunday drives. Irene sniffed when Grace reported
these overtures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re nice fellows; but what have they got
to offer? They&#8217;re never going to get anywhere. You
can&#8217;t afford to waste your time on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Grace accepted one of these invitations.
The young man took her to a public dance hall where
the music was good, but the patrons struck her as
altogether uninspiring; and she resented being inspected
by a police matron. She danced with her
escort all evening, and then they went to a cafeteria
for sandwiches and soda water.</p>

<p>Irene had warned Grace that such young fellows
were likely to prove fresh; that they always expected
to kiss a girl good-night, and might even be insulting;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
but this particular young man was almost pathetically
deferential. Grace was ashamed of herself for not
inviting him to call, but she shrank from encouraging
his further attentions; he might very easily become a
nuisance.</p>

<p>Again, she went to Rosemary Terrace, a dance
and supper place on the edge of town, in company with
a young man who carried a bottle on his hip to which
he referred with proud complacency, as though it
were the symbol of his freedom as an American
citizen. The large dance hall was crowded; the
patrons were clearly the worse for their indulgence in
the liquor carried by their escorts; the dancing of
many of the visitors was vulgar; the place was hot and
noisy and the air heavy with tobacco smoke. Grace&#8217;s
young man kept assuring her that the Rosemary was
the sportiest place in town; you didn&#8217;t see any dead
ones there. His desire to be thought a sport would
have been amusing if he hadn&#8217;t so strenuously insisted
upon explaining that he was truly of the great company
of the elect to whom the laws of God and man
were as nothing. When Grace asked to be taken
home he hinted that there were other places presumably
even less reputable, to which they might go. But
he did not press the matter, when, reaching the Durland
gate, he tried to kiss her and she, to mark the
termination of their acquaintance, slapped him.</p>

<p>These experiences were, she reflected, typical of
what she must look forward to unless she compromised
with her conscience and accepted Irene&#8217;s philosophy
of life.</p>

<p>She had replied immediately to Trenton&#8217;s letter
from St. Louis with a brief note which she made as
colorless as possible. She knew that it was for her
to decide whether to see more of him or drop the acquaintance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
He was not a man to force his attentions
upon any young woman if he had reason to
think them unwelcome. Hearing nothing from him
for several days she had decided that he had settled
the matter himself when she received a note explaining
that he had been very busy but would start East
the next day. He hoped she would dine with him on
Thursday night and named the Indianapolis hotel
where her reply would reach him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t turn him down!&#8221; exclaimed Irene when
Grace told her Trenton was coming. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t
ask you if he didn&#8217;t want you. Tommy skipped for
New York last night so it&#8217;s a safe bet that Ward&#8217;s
stopping on purpose to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&#8221; began Grace doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, have a heart! There&#8217;s no harm in eating dinner
with a married man in a hotel where you&#8217;d get by
even if all your family walked in and caught you! Of
course Tommy can&#8217;t appear with me at any public
place here at home, but it&#8217;s different with you and
Ward. He doesn&#8217;t know a dozen people in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to offend him,&#8221; Grace replied
slowly, a prey to uncertainty; but she withheld her
acceptance until the morning of the day of Trenton&#8217;s
arrival.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>When she reached the Hotel Sycamore at seven
o&#8217;clock he was waiting for her at the entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;On time to the minute!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I took
you at your word that you&#8217;d rather not have me call
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks; but it was easier this way,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>He had been so much in her thoughts, and she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
considered him from so many angles that at first she
was shy in his presence. But by the time they were
seated in the dining room her diffidence was passing.
He appeared younger than at The Shack, but rather
more distinguished; it might have been the effect
of his dinner coat; and she noticed that he was the
only man in the room who had dressed for dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been busy of course and I&#8217;ve been up to
my eyes in work,&#8221; he said; &#8220;so we&#8217;ll dismiss business.
Shall we talk of the weather or see what we can do
to save the world from destruction!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a lot of ideas about things since
I saw you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Half of them were right and
half wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;our old friend conscience!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, meeting his gaze squarely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been trying to decide a thousand questions, but I&#8217;ve
got nowhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Terrible! But I&#8217;m glad to find that you&#8217;re so
human; most of us are like that. Honest, now, you
weren&#8217;t at all sure you wanted to see me tonight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she assented under his smiling gaze; &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t send the answer to your note till nearly noon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I noticed from the hotel stamp on the envelope!
But I&#8217;d have been very much disappointed if you&#8217;d
refused.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was too serious for comfort. She felt that
she must have a care lest he discover the attraction he
had for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;d have got over it! You know you would.
You needn&#8217;t have dined alone&mdash;Tommy&#8217;s out of town,
but there&#8217;s Irene!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much as I admire Irene she would be no substitute!
I was sincerely anxious to see you again, if
only to make sure you were still on earth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;Oh, I have no intention of leaving it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was finding it easy to be flippant with him.
Whatever liking he had for her was no doubt due
to the seriousness she had manifested in their talk
at The Shack. And the effect of that talk had been
to awaken a sympathy and interest on both sides; in
her case she knew that it was trifle more than that.
She was sorry now that she had kissed him; she was
puzzled that she had ever had the courage to do it,
though it was such a kiss as she might have given any
man older than herself in the same circumstances.
She had heard of women, very young women, who were
able to exert a strong influence upon men much older
than themselves. She felt for the first time the power
of sex&mdash;at least she had never before thought of it in
the phrases that now danced through her brain. If
he was annoyed not to find her as interesting and
agreeable as at The Shack he was successful in concealing
his disappointment. He continued to be unfailingly
courteous, meeting her rejoinders with characteristic
mockeries until she began to feel ashamed of her
lack of friendliness. He deserved better of her than
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to the theatre; did you know that?&#8221;
he asked toward the end of the dinner. &#8220;And we&#8217;re
going to be fashionably late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stolen Stars!&#8217; Oh, that&#8217;s perfectly marvelous,&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been just dying to see it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s lucky that you can live and see it!&#8221;
Through the performance the thought kept recurring
to her that he meant to be kind. No one had ever
been so kind or shown her so flattering a deference as
Ward Trenton. She was proud to be sitting beside
him. When the lights went up after the first act a buzz
of talk in one of the boxes drew her attention, and she
caught a glimpse of Bob Cummings. At the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
moment he saw her and bowed. There were six in the
party and she decided that Bob&#8217;s wife was the young
woman he most rarely addressed. Evelyn was not
beautiful; she was gratified to have Trenton&#8217;s confirmation
of her opinion on this point when she directed
his attention to the box party.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here for several days,&#8221; said Trenton when
they reached the Durland house and he stood for a
moment on the doorstep. &#8220;Could you give me another
evening? Tomorrow night I&#8217;m tied up with a business
appointment, but may we say day after tomorrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented, &#8220;but isn&#8217;t there danger of seeing
too much of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the risk!&#8221; he said. &#8220;And thank you ever
so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fell asleep glad that she was to see him again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second evening with Trenton was very like
the first except that after dinner at the Sycamore they
attended a concert given by a world-famous violinist.
Again as under the spell of Bob Cummings&#8217; playing
at Miss Reynolds&#8217;, Grace was caught away into a
wonder-world, where she wandered like a disembodied
spirit seeking some vestige of a personality that had
not survived her transition to another realm. She
was assailed by new and fleeting emotions, in which
she studied Trenton and tried to define her attitude
toward him, conscious that the time might be close
at hand when some definition would be necessary.
Now and then she caught a glimpse of his rapt look
and saw the lines about his mouth tighten. Once he
clasped his hands as though, in response to some inner
prompting, he were attempting by a physical act to
arrest some disturbing trend of his thoughts.</p>

<p>There was a fineness in his face that she had not
before fully appreciated, and it was his fineness and
nobility, Grace assured herself, that appealed to her.
Then there were moments when she was undecided
whether she loved or hated him, not knowing that
this is a curious phase which women of highly sensitive
natures often experience at the first consciousness
of a man&#8217;s power over them. She saw man as
the hunter and woman as his prey. Then with a quick
revulsion she freed herself of the thought and drifted
happily with the tide of harmony.</p>

<p>When they left the theatre Trenton asked whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
she felt like walking. The night was clear and the
air keen and stimulating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; it would be a shame to ride! That
music would carry me a thousand miles,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>As soon as they were free of the crowd he began
to talk of music, its emotional appeal, its power to
dissociate the hearer from material things.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never felt it so much before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid there&#8217;s not much poetry in me. I&#8217;m not much
affected by things that I can&#8217;t reduce to a formula,
and I&#8217;m a little suspicious of anything that lifts me
off the earth as that fiddle did. If I exposed myself
to music very often it would ruin me for business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never that! I feel music tremendously; everybody
must! It wakes up all manner of hopes and
ambitions even if they don&#8217;t live very long. That
violin really made me want to climb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I can understand that. For a few minutes
I was conscious myself of reaching up the ladder for
a higher round. It&#8217;s dangerous to feel so keenly. I
wonder if there ever comes a time when we don&#8217;t feel
any more&mdash;really feel a desire to bump against the
stars; when the spirit goes dead and for the rest of
our days we just settle into a rut with no hope
of ever pulling out? I have a dread of that. It&#8217;s
ghastly to think of. Marking time! Going through
the motions of being alive when you&#8217;re really dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t even think of it! You could never be
like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m like that now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re clear off the key!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Of course
you&#8217;re not at the end of things. It&#8217;s wicked to talk
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think that?&#8221; he asked eagerly. &#8220;Do
you see any hope ahead for me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;You know you see it yourself! We wouldn&#8217;t
any of us go on living if we didn&#8217;t see some hope
ahead.&#8221; Then with greater animation she added:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a man to sit down at the roadside and
burst into tears because things don&#8217;t go to suit you!
I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re that kind at all. If you are&mdash;well,
I&#8217;m disappointed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve got me with my back to the wall!&#8221;
he laughed. &#8220;No man ever wants a woman to think
him a coward. I&#8217;ll keep away from all music hereafter
except the snappiest jazz. But give music the
benefit of the doubt; it may not have been the fiddle
at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More likely you ate too much dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible! The ostrich has nothing on me when
it comes to digestion. Maybe you&#8217;re the cause of
my depression! Please consider that for a moment!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s terribly unkind! If I depress you this
must be our last meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I didn&#8217;t mean that, it&#8217;s because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t begin becausing! You know you&#8217;re in a
tight corner; you hint that I&#8217;ve given you a bad
evening just by sitting beside you at a concert&mdash;and
a very beautiful concert at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mistake is mine! You haven&#8217;t the slightest
respect for my feelings. I show you the wounds in
my very soul and you laugh at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am not going to weep my eyes out
merely because you let a few bars of music throw
you. I had a fit of the blues too; several times I
thought I was going to cry. How embarrassed you&#8217;d
have been!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I should have held your hand until you regained
your composure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d both have been led out by the ushers!&#8221;</p>

<p>He joined with her in playing whimsically upon all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the possibilities of their ejection. They would have
been arrested for disturbing a public gathering and
their names would have figured in the police reports,
probably with pictorial embellishments. This sort
of fooling was safe; she thought perhaps he meant to
maintain the talk on an impersonal plane but in a
moment he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going away tomorrow, first home to Pittsburgh
for about a week; then to New York. I may not
get back here for two or three weeks; I&#8217;m mixed up
in some things that I can&#8217;t neglect. I&#8217;d like to think
you&#8217;ll miss me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I always miss my friends when they go away,&#8221;
she replied. Then realizing the banality of this she
laughed and added: &#8220;How silly that sounded!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you mean you wouldn&#8217;t miss me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I didn&#8217;t mean that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Under a street lamp she saw in his face once more
the grave troubled look that she had observed at intervals
during the concert. It was foolish to question
now that his interest in her was something more than
a passing fancy. Her thoughts flew to the other
woman, the wife of whom he had spoken at The
Shack only to apologize for it in his letter from St.
Louis. He was thinking of her of course; it was impossible
for him to ignore the fact that he had a wife.
And again as so many times before she speculated
as to whether he might not still love this woman
and be seeking diversion elsewhere out of sheer loneliness.
But as they passed into the shadows again,
her hand resting lightly on his arm, she experienced
suddenly a strong desire to be kind to him. She was
profoundly moved by the thought that it was in her
power to pour out to him in great measure the affection
and comradeship which he had confessed he hungered
for.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>They had crossed the canal bridge and were nearing
the Durland house. Trenton was accommodating
himself perforce to her rapid pace. The tonic air kept
her pulses throbbing. She was sure that she loved
this man; that the difference in their years was as
nothing weighed against his need for her. Tonight,
she knew, marked a crisis in their relationship. If she
parted from him without making it clear that she
wished never to see him again she would be putting
herself wholly at the mercy of a fate that might bear
her up or down. With only a block more to traverse
she battled with herself, summoned all her courage to
resist him, only to find that her will was unequal to
the contest.</p>

<p>Deep in her heart she did not want to send him
away with no hope of seeing him again. He was
her one link with the great world beyond the city in
which, without his visits to look forward to, she was
doomed to lead a colorless, monotonous existence.
She was moved by a compassion for him, poignantly
tender, that swept away all sense of reality and transcended
the bounds of time and space. The very
thought of losing him, of not knowing where he would
be in the endless tomorrows, only that she would
never see him again, was like a pain in her heart.
The need in him spoke to the need in her&mdash;for companionship,
help, affection.</p>

<p>They seemed vastly isolated in the quiet street, as
though the world had gone away and left them to
settle their affairs with only the stars for witnesses.
It had been easy to parry Bob Cummings&#8217;s attempts
to assume a lover-like attitude toward her. But with
Trenton this would be impossible. With him it would
be necessary to state in the plainest terms that their
acquaintance must end.</p>

<p>Nothing had been said since her last remark and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
if she meant to thrust him away from her she must
act quickly. In a winning fashion of his own he was
frank and forthright. She found it difficult to anticipate
him and prepare her replies. There was no leer
in him and he did not take refuge in timid gallantries;
he addressed her as a man who felt that he had a
right to a hearing. And this, in her confused, bewildered
senses, gave dignity to the situation. He
loved her and she loved him&mdash;she was sure she loved
him&mdash;and her heart was in a wild tumult. She was
afraid to speak lest the merest commonplace might
betray her eagerness to confess her love for him.</p>

<p>He stepped in front of her and clasped the hand
that lay lightly on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to say it; I must say it now,&#8221; he said in
grave even tones. &#8220;No woman ever meant to me
what you mean. The first night I met you I knew
it had come&mdash;the thing I had hoped for&mdash;and sometimes
had dreaded,&mdash;a woman I could know as I&#8217;ve
never known any woman, not my wife or any other!
After I left you I couldn&#8217;t get you out of my mind.&#8221;
He paused for an instant, then went on hurriedly with
undisguised intensity of feeling. &#8220;You may think me
mad when I&#8217;ve seen you so little; and I know I have
no right to love you at all! But I do love you! I
want you to belong to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>A gust of wind caught up a mass of leaves from the
gutter and flung them about their feet as though
to remind them of the mutability of all things. He
had said that he loved her; almost savagely he had
demanded that she give herself to him. It was incredible
that he cared so much, that his desire for her
could be so great.</p>

<p>He released her hand as though in sign that he
wanted her to speak without compulsion. He waited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
quietly, his shoulders thrown a little forward, and in
the dim starlight she saw his eyes, bright and eager,
searching her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I care,&#8221; she said softly.</p>

<p>The words fell from her lips inevitably; no other
reply was possible, and it seemed that a great weight
had lifted from her heart and that in entrusting herself
to him she had found security and peace. She
questioned nothing, feeling his arms about her, his
kiss warm on her lips. All her doubts were lost in
the joy of the moment in which he had confessed
his love for her. It was a strange place for the
pledging of love and the moment was not to be prolonged.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go on, dear,&#8221; she said laying her cheek
against his for an instant. The touch of her face
caused him to clasp her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dearest one!&#8221; he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>As they went on, loitering to delay the moment of
parting, they caught hands like happy children.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can love me,&#8221; she said with
the anxiety of new love for confirmations and assurances.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t belong to your world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the strangest thing of all!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;We are born into a new world that is all ours. We
have inherited all the kingdoms tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the stars up there&mdash;do they shine just for
us?&#8221; she asked, bringing herself closer to him. &#8220;And
can we keep every one else out of our world? I want
it all to be our very own. Oh, it&#8217;s so sweet, so wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a miracle beyond any words,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to
know that you care. It&#8217;s easy for me to love you;
I loved you in that very first hour we spent together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
We don&#8217;t account for things like that, that come so
suddenly and without warning; we merely accept
them. I&#8217;ve fought this; I want you to know that I&#8217;ve
fought it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so have I! But&mdash;why did you fight it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice betrayed her confused emotions. Her
sense of right was as nothing against the belief that
he loved her and that she loved him. A masterful tide
had caught them up and borne them far, leaving them
islanded on territory remote and touched with a mystical
light that souls had never known before.</p>

<p>She was now fully persuaded that henceforth her
life was to be bound up with his; that until death
took one or the other they would never face separation.
Space and distance were as nothing; if he
went to far and waste places there would be still
the strong spiritual tie which it pleased her to think
was the real bond between them&mdash;something which,
in her absolute surrender, she felt to be above all laws
of men and of kinship with heavenly things. It struck
her as odd that she was able so thoroughly to analyze
her sensations, seeking and finding explanation and
justification cleansed of all passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I have no right to your love; none whatever,&#8221;
he said steadily. &#8220;There are people who would
call me a scoundrel for saying what I have just said
to you. But every man in my plight feels that his
case is different. I&#8217;ve thought of all this in the plainest
terms, not sparing myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be like you to do that,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>Now that she had taken him for her lover she
saw him as a paragon of generosity and nobility. He
would not spare himself; she was anxious to apply
balm to his conscience, to make him understand that
her happiness was so complete that nothing else mattered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;Just so you love me!&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;Nothing
could be so dear as just knowing that you care. Oh,
do I mean so much to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything,&#8221; he exclaimed and lifted her hand and
kissed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it has to be&mdash;everything or nothing.
I never loved any one before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad! I was afraid to ask you that. I had
even thought there might be some one else&mdash;some
younger man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! We&#8217;re not going to talk of ages,&#8221; she
laughed, with a quick gesture laying her hand for a
moment against his lips. &#8220;It must be understood
right now that you&#8217;re not a day over twenty-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to spoil me! And you don&#8217;t know
how much I want to be spoiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor dear! I&#8217;m going to love petting and
spoiling you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly it occurred to her that the other woman,
the unknown wife of her frequent conjecture, had
neither petted nor spoiled him and that this accounted
for his eagerness for a new experience. A cloud
crossed the bright heaven of her happiness. His wife
was not to be relegated to oblivion merely because he
had found another object for his affections. The wife
had a very real existence in Grace&#8217;s imagination; to
Trenton&#8217;s lightly limned sketch the girl had added a
line here and there until she fancied she possessed
a very true portrait of Mrs. Trenton. Somewhere
there existed a Mrs. Ward Trenton, who wrote books
and lectured and otherwise advertised herself as a
vital being.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little girl!&#8221; said Trenton tenderly. &#8220;You
are all the world to me. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must believe that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I can offer you now&mdash;neither a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
home nor the protection of my name. It&#8217;s got to
be just love that&#8217;s our tie. I&#8217;m not going to deceive
you about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand what it means,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must believe that I&#8217;ll do the best I can to
make you happy. Love that doesn&#8217;t bring happiness
is an empty and worthless thing. You don&#8217;t know
how much I count on you. I&#8217;m laying a burden on
you; I&#8217;m clutching at you for all the things I&#8217;ve missed
out of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I know dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something not fair about it&mdash;about casting
myself upon you as I&#8217;m doing,&#8221; he said doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud that you want me! I want to fill your
heart and your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can; you do even now! But first of all I
want you to be sure&mdash;sure of yourself, dear. There
must be no regrets afterward. I can&#8217;t see you again
before I go, but I&#8217;ll write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall miss you so! You <i>will</i> write to me!&#8221; she
cried, feeling already the loneliness of the days of his
impending absence. His calmness was disconcerting
but she readily forgave this as she would have forgiven
him anything. He was thinking of the long
future no doubt, planning ways of seeing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise me you&#8217;ll consider everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough that we love each other!&#8221; she replied
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a child but a woman, able to see it all
in every light. You must be very sure that you care;
that you do love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sure, dear,&#8221; she said, not a little disturbed
by his solicitude, fearing that he himself might
now be a prey to misgivings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;You can write to me at the addresses I&#8217;ll send.
And then wire me when you&#8217;re quite sure&mdash;not till
then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ll do as you say. But tell me again that
you love me! I shall be so lonely without you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart I love you. I wish we need
never part again. Some day that will be. Some day
I can have you with me always! But now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentence died on his lips. What could be now
he did not say, shrank from saying perhaps. It was
not for her to express in words what could be now.
She felt a sudden strong impulse to speak of his wife;
to ask him whether he did not still care for her. But
it was in her heart, the battleground of many and
confused emotions, to give him the benefit of every
doubt. Her forces of defense had mutinied and left
her powerless even to question him. The joy of the
knowledge that he loved her and that she returned
his love thrilled her like the song of triumphant
bugles.</p>

<p>Her heart was throbbing as they passed through
the Durland gate. At the door he took her in his
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest! I wouldn&#8217;t lie to you; I love you
with all my heart. You will write me; and don&#8217;t
forget the telegram. I shall come flying at the first
possible moment after I get that. And don&#8217;t trouble
about anything. I want you to say you trust me
and are sure of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His kisses smothered her replies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise to be careful of yourself, dear. I should
die without you!&#8221;</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes as she fumbled for
her latch key. She watched him as he struck out
with a long stride toward the city. She thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
that he looked back and waved his hand out of the
shadows just as she opened the door.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was long before she slept but she rose obedient
to the summons of the alarm clock and assisted as
usual in the preparation of breakfast. At the table
her silence and preoccupation caused her mother to
scrutinize her closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem quite like yourself, Grace. Don&#8217;t
you feel well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s nothing at all the matter. I had a
hard day at the store yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you ate something for supper that didn&#8217;t
agree with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace read into this suggestion a hint that her
mother and sister were not without their curiosity as
to where she had dined and the manner in which she
had spent the remainder of the evening. They had
been accepting so meekly her silence as to her evenings
away from home that it occurred to Grace
that it would serve to allay suspicion if she told occasionally
just what she had been doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had dinner at the Sycamore with an acquaintance&mdash;a
man from out of town&mdash;and we went to the concert.
The music was perfectly wonderful. And then
we walked home. Nothing terribly exciting in that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard voices at the door just before
you came in,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland with an effort at indifference
that was only partly successful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely you did, mamma. Mr. Trenton and I
walked home; it seemed a pity to ride when the night
was so fine and there was all that music still ringing
in our ears.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>She was pleased with her own audacity and smiled
as she saw Ethel and her mother exchange glances.
But having ventured so far it would be necessary
now to explain how she had met Trenton and she was
prepared with a small lie with which to fortify the
truth when she saw that something more was expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Trenton, did you say, Grace?&#8221; inquired Mrs.
Durland as though not sure she had heard aright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother; Mr. Ward Trenton, of Pittsburgh.
I knew his niece very well at the University, and as
he comes here now and then Mabel wrote and asked
him to look me up. He&#8217;s ever so nice. He&#8217;s been
everywhere and talks wonderfully. He&#8217;s a mechanical
engineer and rated very high, isn&#8217;t he, daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenton&#8217;s name had impinged upon Durland&#8217;s consciousness
and he put down the morning newspaper
to which he had been referring from time to time during
the consumption of his breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward Trenton? Yes, he&#8217;s one of the ablest engineers
in the country. Did you say he&#8217;d been in town,
Grace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he comes here now and then. I had dinner
with him last night at the Sycamore and we went to
the concert. I meant to tell you about him. He
knows of you; he says he&#8217;s always stumbling into you
in the patent office records.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Trenton say that?&#8221; asked Durland, greatly
pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he spoke of you in the kindest way, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! I wouldn&#8217;t have thought he&#8217;d ever
heard of me. He&#8217;s in touch with all the big industrial
concerns of the country,&#8221; said Durland. &#8220;I guess
there is hardly a man whose word is worth more than
Trenton&#8217;s. I read just the other day, in one of the
trade journals, an address he made somewhere on shop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
efficiency. His opinions are quoted a good deal; he
knows what he&#8217;s talking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father&#8217;s manifestation of interest in a man so
eminent in his own field did not prevent Ethel from
taking advantage of Grace&#8217;s unexpected frankness
to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it Mr. Trenton you were with at the theatre
a few nights ago? One of the girls in the office said
she saw you there with a very distinguished looking
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very same!&#8221; Grace replied promptly. &#8220;You
know Mr. Trenton is awful keen about Mabel, so
when she wrote him that I was at Shipley&#8217;s he came
in to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having gone so far with the imaginary niece she
thought it best to endow her with a full name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mabel Conwell is awfully nice, though you
wouldn&#8217;t exactly call her pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she live here?&#8221; asked Mrs. Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Her home&#8217;s in Jeffersonville or New Albany,
I forget which. It&#8217;s one of those Ohio river
towns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was certainly kind of her to have Mr. Trenton
look you up,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;But I wish you&#8217;d
asked him to the house. It doesn&#8217;t seem just right
for you to be going out with a man your family
doesn&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not saying, dear, that there&#8217;s any
impropriety; only I think it would give him a better
impression of all of us if we met him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I meant to bring him up but he&#8217;s so terribly
busy. He works everywhere he goes right up to the
last minute. And it was much simpler to meet him at
the Sycamore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s married, is he not?&#8221; asked Ethel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Grace, heartily regretting now that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
she had opened the way for this question. &#8220;His wife
is Mary Graham Trenton who write and lectures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That woman,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Durland, plainly
horrified. &#8220;She is one of the most dangerous of all
the foes of decency in this country! Last spring we
had a discussion of her ideas in the West End Club.
I hadn&#8217;t known how utterly without shame a woman
could be till one of our members wrote a paper about
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that she&#8217;s very wealthy,&#8221; interposed
Ethel in a tone which suggested that, no matter how
utterly destructive of public morals Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s
ideas might be, as a rich woman she was not wholly
beyond the pale. &#8220;It&#8217;s all the more remarkable that
she&#8217;s opposed to marriage and nearly everything else,
or pretends to be, when she belongs to one of the
oldest American families and inherited her wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that Mr. Trenton accepts her ideas,&#8221;
said Grace. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t discussed them with me. He
seemed rather amused when I told him I&#8217;d read her
&#8216;Clues to a New Social Order&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t read that awful thing?&#8221; cried Mrs.
Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly, mother; I read it last winter. It&#8217;s
not so awfully shocking; I suppose there are a good
many people who believe as Mrs. Trenton does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you speak so, Grace! What would become
of the home and the family if such ideas prevailed?
That woman&#8217;s positively opposed to marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s as bad as that! I think
it&#8217;s more her idea that where marriages are unhappy
it&#8217;s cruel to make people live together. But, you
needn&#8217;t be afraid that Mr. Trenton&#8217;s trying to convert
me to his wife&#8217;s notions. I don&#8217;t believe he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
terribly tickled to have her gallivanting over the country
lecturing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t be too careful, you know, Grace, about
letting a married man pay you attentions. People
are bound to talk. And Mrs. Trenton, being known
for her loose ideas on marriage, naturally causes
people to look twice at her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And at any woman her husband pays attention
to,&#8221; Ethel added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m careful what I do,&#8221; replied Grace.
&#8220;Mr. Trenton is a perfect gentleman in every way
and just as kind and considerate as can be. He gave
me two of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent. You
certainly can&#8217;t object to my knowing a man like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; replied Mrs. Durland, &#8220;except that it
seems strange for a daughter of mine to be meeting
a married man and having dinner with him and going
to the theatre when I don&#8217;t know him at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland had lingered, pretending to be looking for
something in the paper but really prepared to support
Grace in the event that his wife and Ethel showed
a disposition to carry their criticisms further.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we have to put up with such things,&#8221;
said Ethel, &#8220;but that doesn&#8217;t make them right. I
hope, Grace, you won&#8217;t let your independence carry
you <i>too</i> far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Trenton has passed on and I don&#8217;t know
when he&#8217;ll turn up here again, so you needn&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine you can know a man like Trenton,&#8221; Durland
ventured from the hall door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s an idea!&#8221; cried Grace, springing after him
to hold his overcoat, &#8220;the next time Mr. Trenton
comes to town I&#8217;ll try to have you meet him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think some of us ought to meet him,&#8221; said Mrs.
Durland, who had begun to clear the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; Ethel affirmed. &#8220;I think the family
dignity calls for at least that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we must preserve the family dignity at any
hazard,&#8221; Grace retorted.</p>

<p>Having buttoned her father into his coat she
snatched his hat and planted it at a rakish angle on
his head. He submitted good-naturedly, pleased as
he always was by her attentions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bring Trenton down sometime, Grace. I&#8217;ve
some old junk I&#8217;d be glad to show him,&#8221; he said,
glancing furtively at his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grand! Between us we ought to be able to put
something over on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flung her arm across his shoulder and walked
with him to the front door.</p>

<p>No highly developed talent for mind reading was
necessary to an understanding of the mental operations
of Mrs. Durland and Ethel in matters pertaining
to the father and younger daughter. When Grace
entered the kitchen she knew that she had interrupted
a conference bearing upon her acquaintance with
Trenton. Her mother and Ethel would study the matter
in all its aspects. She derived a cynical satisfaction
from the knowledge that her apparent frankness was
probably causing them more anxiety than an evasion
or a downright lie.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Grace&#8217;s thoughts raced madly in the days that followed.
She saw herself in new aspects, dramatized
herself in new and fascinating situations. She was like
a child peering into a succession of alluring shop windows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the nature and value of whose strange wares
it only imperfectly understands. Life was disclosing
itself, opening long vistas before her. As to men
she now believed that she knew a great deal. Confident
that she loved Trenton and without regret that
she had confessed her love she did not question her
happiness. She lived in a paradise whose walls were
fashioned of the stuff that dreams are made of. It
pleased her to think of herself as a figure of romance
and she got from the public library several novels in
which young women, imaginably like herself, had given
their all for love. She was satisfied that her own case
was far more justifiable than those of these heroines.</p>

<p>Her heart was filled with kindness toward all the
world. On the day that brought her Trenton&#8217;s first
letter she went to her father&#8217;s new shop in the Power
Building carrying lunch for two from a cafeteria. Her
father&#8217;s silence in his hours at home, his absorption
in his scientific books, had for her an increasing
pathos. Mrs. Durland referred not infrequently to
the fallen estate of the family in terms well calculated
to wound him from the very tone of helpless resignation
in which they were uttered.</p>

<p>Durland pushed his hat back on his head and stared
as Grace appeared in the door of his little shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Grace? Anything happened?&#8221;
he asked with his bewildered air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing, daddy. I just thought I&#8217;d come
around and have lunch; so here&#8217;s sandwiches for two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never eat lunch,&#8221; he said, turning reluctantly
from the bench at which he had been at work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going to today!&#8221;</p>

<p>Over his protests she cleared a space on the bench
and laid out the contents of her package&mdash;sandwiches,
cakes and apples. She dusted off a chair for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
and then swung herself on to the bench within easy
reach of the food. She ignored his warning that there
was grease on the bench and flung him a paper napkin.</p>

<p>&#8220;The banquet&#8217;s begun! Now proceed and tell me
how every little thing&#8217;s a going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about the same, Grace. I&#8217;m working on an
idea or two. Not sure yet just what I&#8217;ve got, but
I think maybe I&#8217;m on to something that&#8217;ll turn out
big.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re bound to, daddy! You work so hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cummings may have scrapped me too soon,&#8221; he
muttered and looked at her with an ironic grin and
a fanatical gleam in his eyes that caused her to wonder
for a moment whether from his lonely brooding he
might not be going mad.</p>

<p>A man came in to see about some patterns he had
ordered. They were not ready and even while Durland
expressed his regret at the delay Grace saw that
his thoughts were still upon his inventions. The customer
manifested impatience, remarking angrily as
he left that if his work wasn&#8217;t ready the next day
he would take it elsewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, daddy, you oughtn&#8217;t to keep people waiting
when you take their jobs. If you&#8217;ll only build
up this pattern and model business you can make a
good thing of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Grace. But I can&#8217;t keep my mind
off my own work. I know all the weaknesses of my
old things that Cummings is making. I&#8217;m going to
put him out of business!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, but you mustn&#8217;t take jobs for
other people unless you mean to do them right away.
This place is in an awful mess!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she began straightening up a litter of papers on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
one end of the bench a bill for the rent of the room
caught her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at these things, Grace!&#8221; he pleaded, as
he tried to snatch the bill. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be able to pay that in
a day or two. I got a check coming for a model and
it&#8217;ll cover the rent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her questioning elicited the information that the
check had been expected for several weeks and that
the man for whom the model had been made left
town without leaving his address.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems pretty uncertain, daddy, and this rent&#8217;s
three weeks over due. I have a little money in the
trust company and I&#8217;ll send my check for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like taking your money, Grace,&#8221; he said
as she thrust the bill into her purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about that. I&#8217;d be ashamed if I
didn&#8217;t help you when you&#8217;ve always been so good to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where I&#8217;ve done much for you. I
never expected you girls would have to work. You
know I&#8217;m sorry, Grace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m perfectly happy, so don&#8217;t you worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took his old-fashioned watch from his pocket
and noted the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to skip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice of you to come round, Grace; but you&#8217;re always
good to me. By the way, I guess you&#8217;d better
not tell your mother about the rent. She wouldn&#8217;t
like my taking your money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we won&#8217;t say a word!&#8221; She whispered,
touched by his fear of her mother&#8217;s criticisms. She
flung her arms about him and hugged him till he cried
for mercy.</p>

<p>Her savings account was further depleted the next
Saturday. She was surprised to find Roy waiting for
her when she left the department at her lunch hour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;No, sis; I didn&#8217;t write I was coming. I&#8217;ve got to
go back on the first train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course you&#8217;ll see mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I thought I might call her up,&#8221; he said
evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call her up!&#8221; Grace repeated sharply. &#8220;If you&#8217;re
not going out home don&#8217;t call her! She&#8217;d never forgive
you. Come and have lunch with me so we can
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy Durland was tall and fair, a handsome young
fellow, though his face might have been thought too
delicate, a trifle too feminine. One would have known
that as a child he had been pointed out as a very
pretty boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate like thunder bothering you, sis,&#8221; he began
when they were seated in the lunch room. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
up against it hard. Harry Sayles and I got a car from
Thornton&#8217;s garage the other night and took a couple
of girls out for a ride. It was Harry&#8217;s party,&mdash;he was
going to pay for the machine. Well, we were letting
&#8217;er go a pretty good clip, I guess, when something went
wrong with the steering gear and we ran smash into
a barn and mussed things up considerable. Harry and
Freda Barnes were on the front seat and got cut up a
little. We had to wake up a farmer and telephone to
Thornton to send out for us. Thornton wants fifty
dollars to cover his damage and of course I&#8217;ve got to
stand half of it; that&#8217;s only square. He&#8217;s pretty ugly
about it and says if we don&#8217;t come through with the
money he&#8217;ll take it up with the college people. Now
I know, Grace,&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you know you have no business going on joy
rides, particularly with a boy like Harry Sayles who&#8217;s
always in nasty scrapes! Who&#8217;s Freda Barnes? I
don&#8217;t remember a student of that name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she isn&#8217;t exactly a student,&#8221; Roy replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
nervously buttering a piece of bread, &#8220;but she&#8217;s a
perfectly nice girl. She works in Singleton&#8217;s store.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one girl; who was the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sadie Denton; you must remember her; she was
cashier in Fulton&#8217;s for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I never heard of her,&#8221; said Grace eyeing him
coldly. &#8220;You know plenty of nice girls on the campus
and plenty of decent, self-respecting boys. There&#8217;s
not the slightest excuse for you. I suppose Harry provided
the whiskey. There <i>was</i> whiskey of course.
Come, out with the truth about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Roy admitted shamefacedly, &#8220;we did have
a bottle but we didn&#8217;t drink enough of it to make any
difference. Really, Grace, it was an accident; no one
could have helped it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that. I understand now why
you didn&#8217;t want to show yourself at home. The day
I left college you promised to behave yourself and
put in your best licks on your work and already you&#8217;re
mixed up in a nasty scrape. It would break mother&#8217;s
heart if she knew it. Mother&#8217;s crazy about you; she&#8217;d
sacrifice all the rest of us for you, and you evidently
don&#8217;t appreciate it at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand all that, sis. I told you I&#8217;d be glad
to quit and let you stay on and finish. My hanging
on in the law school is all a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t whimper! It&#8217;s too late to weaken now.
You were old enough to know what you were doing
when you took up the law. It begins to look as though
you simply wanted to hang on at the university to loaf
and have a good time. You don&#8217;t deserve any pity for
getting into a mess like this. I suppose the story&#8217;s all
over the campus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he answered quickly, with hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
lighting his eyes. &#8220;Thornton promised to keep his
mouth shut if we&#8217;d pay his bill. And Harry and the
girls won&#8217;t talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagine not! And you&#8217;re letting me into the
secret merely in the hope of getting twenty-five dollars
out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so hard on me, Grace! I know I&#8217;m a
fool and haven&#8217;t sense enough to say no when anybody
asks me to do things like that. But if you&#8217;ll help me
out this time I swear never to bother you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Roy. I haven&#8217;t the money here but I&#8217;ll
walk over to the trust company with you and get it.
But be sure this doesn&#8217;t happen again. I don&#8217;t want
to rub it in but it may help you to keep straight if I
tell you that it&#8217;s just about all we can do to get by at
home. Father is earning nothing; the family&#8217;s clean
busted. Mother&#8217;s pinching and denying herself to be
ready to give you a start when you leave the law
school. I&#8217;m not complaining; I&#8217;m only telling you this
because I don&#8217;t think you mean to make it any harder
for the rest of us than you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a silly mistake,&#8221; he said dully, &#8220;this trying
to make a lawyer of me. I&#8217;ve a good notion to have it
out with mother now and tell her I&#8217;ve come home to
stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do you&#8217;re the rankest kind of quitter! You
could have refused to take up the law when you
graduated from college, but now that you have only
a few more months you&#8217;ve simply got to make good.
Mother would die of humiliation if you stopped.
Come along; we&#8217;ve got to step lively.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Roy,&#8221; she said as she gave him the money at
the teller&#8217;s window: &#8220;Please behave yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>He left her at the store, repeating his promises that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
he would never again ask her for money and assuring
her that he would make the most of his time for the
remainder of the year.</p>

<p>She had dealt with him more severely than it was
in her heart to do and she was a little sorry that she
hadn&#8217;t shown more tolerance for his misadventure.
Fairly considered, his joy-riding with undesirable companions
was hardly more censurable than her participation
in Kemp&#8217;s party at The Shack, a matter as to
which her conscience was still at times a little tender.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Trenton wrote every day, letters in which there was
no attempt to disguise his love for her. He hadn&#8217;t
warned her against keeping his letters but she
destroyed each one after writing her reply. These
answers were little more than notes which she wrote
and rewrote in trepidation lest she say too much or too
little. Now that he had declared himself and was
reiterating daily his complete absorption in her as to
everything that affected his future she could afford to
risk certain reserves and coynesses. But she did love
him; she had positively settled this question. It was
a tremendous thing that had happened to her, the
realization of a great love, love awakened at a first
meeting and endowed with all the charm of romance
and the felicity of clandestine adventure. In one of
her notes, written with her door locked&mdash;her family
imagined her to be zealously devoting herself to her
French studies&mdash;she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is all like a dream. I never cease to marvel that
<i>you</i> should care for me.... Every note you
send me is a happy surprise. If one failed to come I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
think I should die.... You wanted me to take
time to think. That is like my good and true knight.
But I want you to consider too,&mdash;everything....
Your world is so much bigger than mine. Any day
you may meet some one so much finer than I am, so
much worthier of your love.... I like to think
that it all had to be just as it has been,&mdash;you and I
wandering toward each other, guided and urged on
by destiny.</p>
</div>

<p>To her intimations that he might have regrets he replied
in his next message with every assurance that he,
too, shared her feeling that their meeting had been
predestined of all time. Now and then in his life, he
wrote, he had felt the hand of a directing and beneficent
fate. She wondered how he would have replied
to a direct question as to the forces that had
combined to bring about his marriage to the woman
he had no doubt loved at some time, but she refrained.
In Grace&#8217;s thoughts, Mrs. Ward Trenton, the Mary
Graham Trenton who sought clues to social problems
and moved restlessly about the country proclaiming
revolutionary ideas, was receding further and further
toward a vanishing point.</p>

<p>At the end of a week she became restless, eager for
Trenton&#8217;s return. She several times considered telegraphing
him to make haste, but after going once to
the telegraph office at her lunch hour and writing the
message she tore it up. He had asked her to wire
whenever she was sure; the mere sending of a telegram
would commit her irrevocably. It was not so easy as
she had imagined to write the words which meant that
after pondering the matter with the gravity it demanded
she was ready to enter into a relationship with
him which would have no honest status, no protection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
but would be just such an arrangement as Irene
maintained with Kemp.</p>

<p>Irene, aware of Trenton&#8217;s daily letters, now refrained
from giving her further encouragement to the
affair. On the other hand she seemed disposed to
counsel caution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some days you seem as cheerful as a spring robin
and then again you don&#8217;t seem so chipper. You don&#8217;t
want to take your love affairs so hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re just having a little flirtation, that&#8217;s all,&#8221;
said Grace carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the way you&#8217;re acting! You&#8217;re terribly
intense, Grace. I knew you had temperament, but I
didn&#8217;t know you had so much. But I&#8217;ll say this for
Ward, that he&#8217;s a fine, manly fellow,&mdash;frankly a much
finer type than Tommy Kemp. Tommy&#8217;s a sport and
Ward isn&#8217;t. Ward really has ideals, but such as
Tommy has don&#8217;t worry him much.&#8221;</p>

<p>This left Grace, again a prey to doubts, wondering
whether after all Trenton was so utterly different from
Kemp. Intellectually he was a higher type than
Tommy Kemp, but when it came to morals he was
not a bit better.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Grace had not yet wholly escaped from the effect of
Dr. Ridgely&#8217;s sermon, with its warning against the
too-readily-found excuse for wrong-doing. She continued
to observe carefully her associates in Shipley&#8217;s
and other business girls she became acquainted with,
and she had no reason for suspecting that by far the
greater number were not high-minded young women
who met cheerily all the circumstances of their lives.
She found herself stumbling uncomfortably over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
excuses she made for herself. Other girls forced to
labor and blessed with equal charm and wit did not
find it necessary &#8220;to play around with married men&#8221;
as the phrase went, or encourage the attentions of
young unmarried men who were not likely to show
them every respect. There were societies and associations
whose purpose was to safeguard young
womanhood; some of her new acquaintances were
members of such organizations. She accepted invitations
to go for lunch or supper to several of these,
but thought them dull.</p>

<p>Finding that Grace hadn&#8217;t attempted to enlist Miss
Reynolds in the girl&#8217;s club of Dr. Ridgley&#8217;s church,
Ethel Durland had sent the pastor himself to invite
that lady to one of the meetings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will come Tuesday night,&#8221; said Ethel,
when she reported this to Grace. &#8220;We want Miss
Reynolds to see the scope of our work and your being
there will be a help. Maybe you&#8217;d ask some of the
girls in Shipley&#8217;s? We want to have a record attendance.
And we want the girls to bring their young
men friends with them. It&#8217;s our idea that the girls
should feel that the church is like another home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attempt to establish a new high record of attendance
brought twenty-five girls and four young
men to the church parlors. Three of the young women
were from Shipley&#8217;s and they had gone at Grace&#8217;s earnest
solicitation; four were Servians, employed in a
garment factory, and they were convoyed by young
men of their own race.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d be specially nice to those Servian
girls,&#8221; Ethel remarked to Grace. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t easy to
get them to come, but they brought their beaux with
them. We must be sure they have a good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beaux did not seem to relish the hopeless minority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of their sex. The meeting was opened formally
by Ethel as chairman of the entertainment committee.
She introduced Dr. Ridgely, who expressed
the hope that the club would develop into one of the
strongest agencies of the church. He referred to religion
only indirectly. Grace was again impressed by
his sincerity; and he was tactful and gracious in his
effort to put the visitors at ease. He would not
linger, he said, as a reminder that they were in a
church; the evening was theirs and he wanted the
club to manage its own affairs and define its own
policy to meet the tastes and needs of the members.
No one of any shade of religious faith could have
taken offense from anything he said or feared that
the pastor wished to use the club for proselyting purposes.
However, when he had left, Ethel Durland extended
an invitation to those present who were not
already enrolled in the Sunday school to become
affiliated, and urged attendance upon the regular
church services.</p>

<p>&#8220;How tactless! Why couldn&#8217;t she let well enough
alone!&#8221; whispered Miss Reynolds to Grace. &#8220;Dr.
Ridgely knows better than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister has a strong sense of duty,&#8221; Grace answered.
&#8220;She couldn&#8217;t bear to let the opportunity
go by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She might have waited at least till they&#8217;d got
their refreshments,&#8221; Miss Reynolds retorted.</p>

<p>A young lady elocutionist who had volunteered her
services recited a number of poems after Ethel had
prepared the way with a few words on the new movement
in poetry. The audience manifested no great interest
in the movement and seemed utterly mystified
by the poems offered. However, Ethel now announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
that the formal exercises were concluded and that they
would repair to the basement where there would
be dancing. Ethel, who did not dance herself and
thought it a wicked form of amusement, had yielded
reluctantly to the suggestion of the other members of
the committee that dancing be included in the programme.
Dr. Ridgely had given his approval on the
ground that young people were bound to dance somewhere
and as there was so much criticism of the prevailing
fashion in dancing he thought it highly desirable
to provide the amusement under auspices calculated
to discourage the objectionable features complained
of in the public dance halls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where are all the young men?&#8221; inquired Miss
Reynolds as she stood beside Grace in the basement.
&#8220;Those four Servians look frightened to death and
girls don&#8217;t enjoy dancing with each other. If the
church is going to do this thing, why don&#8217;t they do it
right? You&#8217;d think the committee would have got
some young men here if they&#8217;d had to ask the police to
drag them in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The music was provided by two negroes, one of
whom played the piano and the other the drum. As
Twentieth Century dance music it was not of a high
order. The musicians, duly admonished by the Chairman
of the entertainment committee, were subduing
their performance in the attempt to adjust it to the
unfamiliar and sobering environment. And the room
itself was not a particularly inspiring place for social
entertaining. A map of the Holy Land and several
enlarged photographs of early members of the church
were the only adornments of the plaster wall, and
the chairs were of that unsteady, collapsible type that
suggest funerals and give the sitter a feeling of undergoing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
penance for grievous sins. The low ceiling
was supported by iron pillars that added nothing to
the pleasure of dancing.</p>

<p>A number of girls began dancing together and after
some persuasion Grace succeeded in getting the four
couples of Servians on the floor. The young men
danced with something of a ceremonial air as though,
finding themselves in an alien atmosphere, they wished
fitly to represent the dignity and pride of their race.
Grace picked out several young girls who were huddled
helplessly in a corner and danced with them and
then seized upon the young men and introduced them
in the hope of breaking the racial deadlock. The
young fellows proved to be painfully shy when
confronted by the necessity of dancing with girls they
had never seen before. Nevertheless Grace&#8217;s efforts
resulted in putting some life and animation into the
party. It had been said of her in college that she had
the knack of making things go and it struck her suddenly
that something might be done to inject some
spirit and novelty into the occasion by asking the
Servians to give their folk dances. One of the Servian
girls undertook to instruct the negroes in the rhythms
required for the folk dances and the young woman&#8217;s
vivacity and the negroes&#8217; good-natured eagerness to
meet her wishes evoked much merriment. The dances
were given with spirit in a circle formed by the rest
of the company, who warmly applauded the quaint
performance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always wanted to try these folk dances myself!&#8221;
cried Grace appealing to the tallest of the young men.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you teach me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He would be honored, he said, and the girl with whom
he had been dancing went to the piano. Grace quickly
proved herself an apt and enthusiastic pupil. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
she had learned the postures and steps of one of the
group dances her instructor took her as his partner and
she went through with it without an error. Others of
the American girls now began trying the steps with
the Servian young men and women, who entered zestfully
into the work of teaching them. The result was
the breaking down of restraint and by the time the refreshments
were served the room presented a scene
of gaiety and good fellowship.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a genius for that kind of thing, my dear;
you managed that beautifully,&#8221; said Miss Reynolds to
Grace as they assisted in pouring chocolate and passing
sandwiches. &#8220;You saved the evening! Dear me!
There&#8217;s something wrong with this. As an effort to
interest young people in the church this club can&#8217;t
say much for itself. Girls won&#8217;t go where there are
no young men; I imagine young men are not easy to
lure into church parlors to hear poetry read to them,
particularly poetry that doesn&#8217;t mean anything. And
this cellar and the piano and drum can&#8217;t compete with
a big dance hall and a real jazz band. This has been
going on about like this for several years, but without
as many girls as came tonight. I don&#8217;t know what
could be done, but this doesn&#8217;t seem worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the answer either,&#8221; said Grace, who,
more or less consciously, was observing this attempt
to do something for working girls with reference to
her own problems. Her reading had made her familiar
with the efforts of church organizations to meet the
social needs of the changing times. It seemed to her
that these all presupposed a degree of aspiration in
the class sought to be helped. And knowing herself
to have enjoyed probably the best opportunities as to
education of any girl in the room she was troubled,
knowing how feeble was her hold on such ideals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
conduct as only a little while ago she had believed
herself to possess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Miss Reynolds, &#8220;those people are
right who say we&#8217;re running too much to organizations.
We start a club like this and stick it in a
church basement and are terribly pleased with ourselves.
These girls are all good girls; naughty girls
wouldn&#8217;t come; they can have a better time somewhere
else. And they&#8217;re just the ones we&#8217;ve got to
reach. Am I right about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are,&#8221; replied Grace, wondering what
Miss Reynolds would say if she could read her
thoughts. To drop Trenton while it was still possible
would make it necessary to reconcile herself to the
acceptance of just such pleasures as Ethel thought
sufficient social stimulus for girls who worked for a
living.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t the church members come to these
meetings?&#8221; Miss Reynolds demanded, &#8220;or send their
sons and daughters? The minister of this church has
sense and I&#8217;ll wager he sees that side of it. A miserable
thing like this only strengthens class feeling. I
don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s any way of making such a club
go. The church is put in the position of tagging the
rich and the poor so nobody can mistake one for the
other. I think I&#8217;ll spend my time and money on individual
cases&mdash;find a few young people who really
need help and concentrate on them!&#8221;</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock the musicians left and the entertainment
came to an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful to you, Grace, for helping; this is
the best meeting we&#8217;ve ever had,&#8221; said Ethel after
she had pressed a folder describing the church&#8217;s activities
upon the last of the company. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
our work well worth while, Miss Reynolds?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;I was greatly interested,&#8221; Miss Reynolds replied
evasively.</p>

<p>She took Grace and Ethel home in her car but did
not encourage Ethel&#8217;s attempt to discuss the evening.
However, in bidding Ethel good-night she said she
would send her a check for one hundred dollars for
the girls&#8217; club.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your work is important, Miss Durland; I sympathize
with the purpose; but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve got
quite the right plan. But I confess that I have no
suggestion worth offering. I realize that it&#8217;s not easy
to solve these problems.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Grace was not happy! Much as she tried to avoid
the flat conclusion, the best she could do was to twist
it into a question. Love was a worthless thing if its
effect was merely to torture, to inflict pain. She had
told Trenton that she loved him and had virtually
agreed to accept him on his own terms. Why, as the
days passed, was she still doubting, questioning, challenging
her love for him?</p>

<p>At the end of a rainy day that had been full of
exasperations Grace left the store to take the trolley
home. The rain had turned to sleet that beat spitefully
upon her umbrella and the sidewalks were a
mass of slush. She was dreading the passage home
in the crowded car and the evening spent in her room,
thinking of Trenton, fashioning her daily letter. She
had begun to hate her room where every object seemed
to be an animate, malevolent embodiment of some
evil thought. She had half decided to persuade her
father to brave the weather and return down town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
after supper to go to a picture show when, turning the
corner, she heard her name called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there, Grace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bob, is it you?&#8221; she cried peering out at
Cummings from under her umbrella.</p>

<p>He took her umbrella and fell into step with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so scared; of course it&#8217;s I. Frankly
this isn&#8217;t just chance alone; I&#8217;ve been lying in ambush!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This will never do!&#8221; she cried, but in spite of
herself she was unable to throw any resentment into
her tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a grand idea!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m playing
hooky tonight. Evelyn called me up this afternoon
to ask if I&#8217;d go to dine with an uncle of hers who&#8217;s
having a birthday. These family parties are bad
enough at Christmas and Thanksgiving but when they
begin ringing in birthdays I buck. So I told Evelyn
I was too tired to go and that I had a business engagement
anyhow, and would get my dinner down
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realize that I&#8217;m getting wet? You beat it
for your family party; I&#8217;m going home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Grace, don&#8217;t desert me!&#8221; he replied coaxingly.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a cozy supper together and I&#8217;ll
get you home early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I&#8217;d never see you again!&#8221; she said indignantly.
&#8220;You have no excuse for waylaying me
like this. It&#8217;s unpardonable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so cruel!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be awfully
nice&mdash;honestly I will! You won&#8217;t have a thing to be
sorry for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Firm as her resolution had been not to see him
again she was weighing the relief it would be to avoid
going home against the danger of encouraging him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;Where are your manners, sir? You haven&#8217;t even
offered to drive me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God pity us homeless children in the great city tonight!&#8221;
he cried, aware that she was relenting. &#8220;My
car&#8217;s parked yonder by the Sycamore Tavern. The
night invites the adventurous spirit. We&#8217;ll dare the
elements and ride hard and fast like king&#8217;s messengers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you keep that up&mdash;just that way&mdash;pretending
we&#8217;re two kids cutting up, as we used to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Grace; you may count on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m tired and bored with myself, and was
dreading the ride home&mdash;I&#8217;ll go! But whither?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To McGovern&#8217;s house of refreshment at the border
of a greenwood, known to Robin Hood in olden
times!&#8221; cried Cummings, elated by her consent.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop at the Sycamore and I&#8217;ll telephone the
varlet to make the coffee hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I supped there once, years agone! But the crowd
was large and boisterous,&#8221; she replied, now entering
fully into the spirit of the proposed adventure. Their
attempt at archaic speech recalled their youthful delight
in the Arthurian legends in days when their world
was enfolded in a golden haze of romance.</p>

<p>It was impossible to think of Cummings otherwise
than as a boy, and a foolish boy, but amusing when
the humor was on him as now, and to have supper
with him would work injury to no one.</p>

<p>While he talked to McGovern she went into a booth
and explained to her mother that she wouldn&#8217;t be
home for supper, saying that she was going to a
movie with a girl friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;All set?&#8221; asked Cummings. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine. We&#8217;ll
move right along. You&#8217;ll be in early; that&#8217;s a cinch.
Evelyn&#8217;s sure to be home by ten and I&#8217;ll be practising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Chopin furiously when she gets back from her uncle&#8217;s.
Mac wasn&#8217;t keen about taking us in as he shuts down
at the first frost. But that&#8217;s all the better; nobody
else would think of going there on such a night!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were planning with much absurd detail the
strategy of their approach to a beleaguered capital when
they reached McGovern&#8217;s and were warmly welcomed
by the proprietor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It gets mighty lonesome out here in the winter,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The missus thought you&#8217;d like having supper
right here in the living room so you could sort o&#8217;
chum with the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a heavenly idea,&#8221; said Grace, eyeing the
table with covers laid for two. Mrs. McGovern, a
stout woman whose face shone with good nature, appeared
and bade her husband help bring in the dishes.
Whereupon Cummings and Grace rushed to the
kitchen to assist and filed in behind him, bearing serving
dishes and singing a song they had learned in their
childhood:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">&#8220;It&#8217;s over the river to feed the sheep,</div>
<div class="indent2">It&#8217;s over the river to Charlie;</div>
<div class="verse">It&#8217;s over the river to feed the sheep</div>
<div class="indent2">And measure out the barley!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The wind whined in the chimney and somewhere a
shutter banged spitefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only touch we needed to make a perfect
evening!&#8221; said Grace, her cheeks glowing. &#8220;I expect
to hear a stage coach come tearing into the yard any
minute pursued by highwaymen. How did you ever
come to think of McGovern&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;Just one of my little happy thoughts! Now that
we&#8217;ve found the way there&#8217;s no reason why we can&#8217;t
repeat,&#8221; said Cummings.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go! This doesn&#8217;t establish a precedent;
it belongs to those experiences it&#8217;s better never to try
again. But, it&#8217;s certainly jolly so far as we&#8217;ve gone.
What if somebody should come prancing in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a good night for prancing. McGovern
said there hadn&#8217;t been a soul here for a week. That&#8217;s
why he let us come, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can think of certain persons who wouldn&#8217;t add
much to the joy of this particular party,&#8221; said Grace
musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little danger adds to the fun! You seem to forget
that I thought it all up; I&#8217;m ready to go right on
round the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are!&#8221; she retorted teasingly. &#8220;It sounds
awful but sometimes I think it&#8217;s cowardice that keeps
most of us good! If you were a philosopher I&#8217;d ask
your opinion on that subject but I see you haven&#8217;t a
ghost of an idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned. There had always been a serious side
to Grace. In her high school days she was constantly
dipping into books that were beyond her, treatises
on social science and the like that only depressed him.
He didn&#8217;t know, of course, how eagerly she had caught
at the opportunity of spending the evening with him
merely to enjoy a few hours freedom from the turmoil
of her own soul. It interested her for a moment to
sound him as to whether by any chance he was conscious
of the general transformation of things or knew
that their visit to McGovern&#8217;s in itself had a significance;
but he was a dreamer who responded only to
the harmonies of life and avoided all its discords. He
was caught up in the whirligig of apparently changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
conditions just as she knew herself to be. Were they
really breaking down the old barriers? Or was the
world, aided by gasoline and jazz, moving so rapidly
that in the mad rush it required a more alert eye to
discern the danger signs?</p>

<p>The fact that she was eating supper with another
woman&#8217;s husband in a place frankly chosen for its
isolation interested her, as so many social phenomena
had interested her since she left the University.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thunder!&#8221; he said with a shrug. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
use in our worrying. Let the old folks do that. I
guess we&#8217;ve all got a right to be happy and tastes differ
as to what happiness is. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, of course, wasn&#8217;t all, but she refrained from
saying so. A look came into his eyes that warned her
to have a care. She must guard herself from an attempt
on his part, which she saw was impending, to
take advantage of the hour to make love to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;every time I get blue it&#8217;s
you I want to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush, tush! I&#8217;d never have come if I&#8217;d thought
you were going to be foolish. Don&#8217;t you get the
notion into your silly head that you can run to me
every time you get down in the mouth. There&#8217;s no
reason why I should hold your hand when you&#8217;re sorrowful;
I don&#8217;t want the job!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was eating with an honest appetite that discouraged
his hope of interesting her in sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! I thought you&#8217;d jump at the offer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have another biscuit! I want to laugh! How
silly this is, Bob! I supposed you brought me out
here to show me a good time and we&#8217;re almost at the
point of quarreling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Grace, we&#8217;ll never do that! I didn&#8217;t think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
you&#8217;d mind the compliment! But,&#8221; dolefully, &#8220;I suppose
you get so many!&#8221;</p>

<p>He became tractable, obedient, anxious to please
her. She knew that she could do with him very much
as she pleased; but there was no satisfaction in the
exercise of her power over so unstable a character.
She was sorry for him, much as she would have been
sorry for a child who never quite learned his lessons;
and there were lessons Bob Cummings would never
learn.</p>

<p>After they had eaten their dessert they started the
victrola and danced, and Bob was again the good play-fellow.
They began burlesquing classic dances, and
laughed so boisterously at their success in making
themselves ridiculous that McGovern and his wife
came in to watch them. They had brought themselves
to a high pitch of merriment when McGovern, who
was assisting his wife in clearing the table, darted
across the room and stopped the music.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord; it&#8217;s some one knocking!&#8221; cried Bob,
as the outer door shook under a heavy thumping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just keep quiet,&#8221; said McGovern. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s
some one who&#8217;s got into trouble on the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People stop for a little gas to help &#8217;em out sometimes,&#8221;
said Mrs. McGovern. &#8220;Mac&#8217;ll get rid of
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>McGovern, with his shoulder against the door
threw a look of inquiry at Cummings and Grace.
Cummings lifted his head as the voice again demanded
admittance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like Atwood,&mdash;a chap I know,&#8221; he said to
Grace. &#8220;Who&#8217;s with him, Mac?&#8221;</p>

<p>As McGovern opened the door a few grudging
inches a male voice called him by name.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;Let us in, Mac: we&#8217;re freezing to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, but we&#8217;re closed for the season,&#8221; McGovern
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t go, Mac! You can&#8217;t turn <i>me</i> down,&#8221;
replied the voice.</p>

<p>Before McGovern could answer a vigorous pressure
flung the door open and a young man stepped in followed
by a young woman in a fur coat and smart
toque.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never thought you&#8217;d shut the door in my face,
Mac!&#8221; said the young man reproachfully. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
to have some coffee and sandwiches. Hello, Mrs.
Mac: how&#8217;s everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman, blinking in the light, was walking
toward the fireplace when she became aware that McGovern
and his wife had been entertaining other
guests. She paused and stared, her gaze passing
slowly from Cummings to Grace. Her companion,
finding that McGovern and his wife were receiving
coldly his voluble expressions of regard, now first
caught sight of the two figures across the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello-o-o!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Look who&#8217;s here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jimmie, is that you?&#8221; said Cummings with
a gulp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it some night! And Mac, the old pirate,
didn&#8217;t want to let me in!&#8221;</p>

<p>The McGoverns were hastily retiring toward the
kitchen, Mac tiptoeing as though leaving a death
chamber. The weight of his grievous error was upon
him; never before had he precipitated a wife upon a
husband in so disturbing a fashion.</p>

<p>Grace was watching the young woman, who pulled
a chair away from the table that still bore evidences
of the recent repast and sank into it. She was tall and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
slender and the light struck gold in her hair. Feeling
perhaps that Grace&#8217;s eyes were upon her, she bent and
plucked a raveling, real or imaginary, from the skirt of
her coat. She unbottoned her coat and drew off her
gloves with elaborate care.</p>

<p>Her companion stood with his hands thrust into the
pockets of his overcoat, grinning. An old-fashioned
clock on the mantel began to strike to the accompaniment
of queer raspings of its mechanism. The hands
indicated the hour as ten but in the manner of its
kind the hammer within pounded out twelve. There
was a suggestion of insolence in the protracted thumping
of the bell. As the last torturing sound was dying
Grace turned her head slightly to look at Cummings,
who was staring blankly at the lady in the fur coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a funny clock!&#8221; Atwood remarked with the
jubilant tone of one who has made a discovery of
great value to mankind.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dreadful liar!&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandfather used to have one just like it, with
a basket of fruit painted on the door,&#8221; said Atwood,
advancing toward Grace, beaming with gratitude for
her response to his attempt to promote conversation.
He was short, plump and blond, with thin fair hair already
menaced by baldness. He was not far advanced
in the twenties and looked very much like an overgrown
school boy. Grace appraised him as a person
of kindly impulses and possibly not wholly without
common sense.</p>

<p>Having planted himself beside Grace he remarked
further upon clocks and their general unreliability,
while he rolled his eyes first toward Cummings and
then in the direction of the lady in the fur coat. Grace
had already assumed without the aid of this telegraphy
that the lady was Bob&#8217;s wife. Atwood seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
appealing to Grace to assist him in terminating a situation
that was verging upon the intolerable, but she
was unable to see that it was incumbent upon her to
take the initiative. But Mrs. Cummings might sit there
forever unless something happened. Bob continued to
wear the look of one condemned and awaiting the
pleasure of the executioner. Grace felt strongly
moved to walk up to him and shake him. She had
read of such unfortunate meetings between husband
and wife and they were usually attended with furious
denunciations and sometimes with pistols. Without
the sustaining presence of Atwood she would have retired
to the domestic end of the McGovern establishment
and waited for the storm to blow over, but the
storm, if such impended, was slow in developing.</p>

<p>&#8220;This can&#8217;t last forever,&#8221; said Grace in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;If <i>something</i> doesn&#8217;t happen in a minute I&#8217;m a
dead man,&#8221; Atwood whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be nice if we all got acquainted.
I&#8217;m Miss Durland, Mr. Atwood,&#8221; said Grace in a tone
audible throughout the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much! I was just dying to know
your name!&#8221; he declared fervidly. &#8220;Oh, Evelyn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Evelyn lifted her head and looked at him defiantly,
but he squared himself and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Cummings, Miss Durland. I really supposed
you had met before.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice rose to an absurd squeak as he expressed
this last hopeful sentiment.</p>

<p>Evelyn bit her lip and nodded, a nod that might
have been intended for Grace or quite as definitely
for an enlarged photograph of an ancestral whiskered
McGovern in a gilt frame that adorned the wall behind
her.</p>

<p>Grace glanced at Bob, still rooted to the floor, and
he remarked with badly-feigned cheerfulness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;Well, I suppose we might as well go home&mdash;&#8221;
a suggestion not without ambiguity, as there were four
persons in the room and two at least, having just arrived
and awaiting refreshments, might be assumed
to prefer to linger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just yet!&#8221; said Grace, walking slowly toward
Evelyn. &#8220;There&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to say to Mrs.
Cummings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>really</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going in a minute,&#8221; interposed Cummings,
with sudden animation. &#8220;I think maybe, Grace&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace!&#8221; Evelyn repeated scornfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
home. Jimmy, I want you to take me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Evelyn; of course we&#8217;ll go whenever you
like,&#8221; said Atwood. &#8220;But, we ought to explain things
a little. I mean you and I ought to explain them,&#8221; he
elaborated as he saw her lips tighten. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
want Bob to think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what Bob thinks!&#8221; she flared. &#8220;He
lied to me; he told me he had a business engagement,
to get out of taking me to Uncle Fred&#8217;s! And this
was the engagement!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But everything&#8217;s going to be explained,&#8221; Atwood
persisted. &#8220;You know there&#8217;s always an explanation
for everything, and Bob&#8217;s the best fellow in the world&mdash;you
know that Evelyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of the kind! I&#8217;ll let him know
at the proper time and place what I think of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, Evelyn,&#8221; said Atwood with his odd
little pipe of a laugh. But he was very earnest; he
brought Cummings to his side by an imperious gesture.
As the man for the hour he was not acquitting
himself so badly; he looked at Grace for her approval,
wasn&#8217;t sure that she gave it, but with his hand resting
on Cummings&#8217;s shoulder, he spoke directly to the
point.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry about this, Bob. You know I&#8217;m
in and out of your house a lot and you never seem to
mind. And tonight I tried to get you on the telephone
to see if we could do something, the three of us I mean,&mdash;run
down to see a picture or any old thing&mdash;and the
maid said you were at Colonel Felton&#8217;s; both of you,
I thought she meant. And I called up there about the
time I thought the party would be over and found you
weren&#8217;t there and asked Evelyn to let me come for her.
And I thought it would be good fun to take a little dash
through the storm and I knew you wouldn&#8217;t care.
There couldn&#8217;t be any harm in that; we&#8217;ve all been
out here together lots of times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s perfectly all right, Jimmie!&#8221; exclaimed
Cummings with a flourish of magnanimity which did
not, however, awaken the grateful response he may
have expected from Evelyn, who had murmured an
indifferent, &#8220;Thank you, Jimmie,&#8221; when Atwood concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing tragic about this,&#8221; Cummings began
a little defiantly. &#8220;Miss Durland and I have
known each other all our lives. She&#8217;s an old friend.
She came out with me just as a lark; just as you and
Jimmie came. I don&#8217;t want you to think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do!&#8221; said Evelyn rising so suddenly that
Cummings backed away from her in alarm. &#8220;Anything
you have to say to me needn&#8217;t be said before
this old friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Evelyn, you&#8217;re not fair!&#8221; cried Cummings
hotly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair to Miss Durland. The whole
fault of her being out here is mine. I&#8217;ll not have
you think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re terribly anxious about what I think!&#8221;
Evelyn interrupted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll think what I please!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace, on her way to the sofa on which she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
left her coat and hat, swung round, her face aflame.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not occur to you, Mrs. Cummings, that
what you think isn&#8217;t of the slightest importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You act as though you thought it was!&#8221; Evelyn
flung back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not acting; you&#8217;re doing enough of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve probably had far more experience in such
scenes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With much better actors than your husband, I
hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re going to like each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The regret is not mine, I assure you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace turned to a mirror to straighten her hat. Her
preparations for departure were provocative of
thought in Atwood&#8217;s mind. He expressed the thought
immediately, evidently with the laudable hope of
lessening the tension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Durland, won&#8217;t you let <i>me</i> take you
home? I can run you into town without the slightest
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evelyn&#8217;s surprise at this suggestion betrayed itself
in a spurt of coffee that missed the cup she was filling
and spread in an amber stain on the table cloth.</p>

<p>Grace was walking toward the veranda door drawing
on her gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much, Mr. Atwood,&#8221; she said
evenly. &#8220;But Mr. Cummings is going to take me
home!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cummings glanced at his wife, uncertainty plainly
written on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;yes&mdash;&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting, Bob!&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>He gathered up his raincoat and cap. Grace waited
for him to open the door for her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>&#8220;Good-night, Mr. Atwood!&#8221; she flung over her
shoulder, and the door closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there was that!&#8221; Cummings said after they
were in the highway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re satisfied with yourself,&#8221; said Grace
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord! Didn&#8217;t I do the best I could about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have done worse if you&#8217;d had a
week to plan it! Instead of standing there like a
fool when your wife came in, why didn&#8217;t you walk
right up to her like a man and introduce me? You
were scared to death; you thought of nothing but
how you were going to square yourself with her. You
did everything you could to give her the idea that
you were ashamed of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Grace, you can&#8217;t mean this!&#8221; He slowed
down the car the better to talk. &#8220;God knows I did
the best I could. I couldn&#8217;t help being surprised when
they came in. And you never can tell how Evelyn&#8217;s
going to take anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; it was Evelyn you were troubled about;
you weren&#8217;t at all worried about me! When you
came out of your trance and tried to explain how I
came to be there the mischief was already done. Of
course she wouldn&#8217;t listen to you then. You certainly
made a mess of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you at all! I swear I did
the best I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was a pretty poor best! Please mind
what you&#8217;re doing; you&#8217;re still so nervous you&#8217;ll land
in the ditch in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus admonished he steadied himself at the wheel.
Her anger had expended itself and she was now
silently staring ahead at the snow covered road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>No word had passed between them for several
minutes and Grace, absorbed in her own thoughts, was
hoping that he wouldn&#8217;t attempt to discuss the matter
further. Her respect for him was gone; she
disliked him cordially, seeing him only as a timid,
evasive person whose primary impulse was self-protection.
He might play on the wrong side of a forbidden
wall but the moment he was discovered he
would scramble for safe territory.</p>

<p>He touched her hand so suddenly that she started
and snatched it away with a feeling of aversion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve both been thinking about what happened
back there,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know just where it
leaves me; I don&#8217;t know how Evelyn is going to
take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, bending forward while he waited for
some encouragement to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how Evelyn is going to take it! I
thought I&#8217;d made it clear that I didn&#8217;t want to talk of
your private affairs any more. They don&#8217;t interest
me in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course if Evelyn wants a row&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob! <i>Please</i>, be quiet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t leave it this way! You&#8217;ve meant too
much to me for us to part like this. What I was
going to say was&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed despairingly and resettled herself in her
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want you to know is that I care a lot for
you, Grace&mdash;and if there&#8217;s a row&mdash;if we break up,
Evelyn and I, I mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve lost your mind!&#8221; she cried furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you don&#8217;t see&mdash;you don&#8217;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I do! If Evelyn turns you out you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
maybe you&#8217;d like to give <i>me</i> a trial! That&#8217;s certainly
an idea! I suppose you have visions of me figuring
in your divorce suit&mdash;Cummings against Cummings!
I don&#8217;t believe you used to be like this. It&#8217;s astonishing
how you&#8217;ve deteriorated!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect this from you, Grace!&#8221; he replied
bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve felt that I could always count on
you to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The engine began to cough peevishly and he stopped
to investigate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s luck!&#8221; he exclaimed spitefully as he got
back into the car. &#8220;Just about enough gas to pull
us to that garage half a mile ahead. I guess somebody&#8217;s
pinned a jinx on the evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait outside,&#8221; she said when the car had been
coaxed to the garage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a minute, Grace. I&#8217;m awfully sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she stood on the cement driveway the whistle
followed by a flash of the headlight of an incoming
interurban car on the track that ran parallel with the
highway caught her attention. Across the road several
people were waiting on the platform and she
resolved to board the car if it stopped before Cummings
reappeared. She was in a humor to annoy him
if she could and as the car slowed down she began
to walk slowly toward the platform and then with a
glance over her shoulder ran and swung herself aboard.
As the car got under way she caught a glimpse of the
roadster as Cummings backed it out. She derived
no small degree of satisfaction from the reflection that
her departure in this fashion expressed her scorn
of him more effectually than anything she could have
said.</p>

<p>She left the car at the interurban station and walked
home. Her knowledge of life was broadening and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
that too in divisions of the Great Curriculum of whose
very existence she had had only the haziest consciousness.
Her freedom, the independence she so greatly
prized, was not without its perils. Her thoughts took
a high range; she wondered whether after all the individual
could, without incurring serious hazards,
ignore the warnings and safeguards established for the
protection of society.</p>

<p>She wanted to laugh over the encounter at McGovern&#8217;s,
but in the quiet street it was not so
easy to laugh at it. What society had done to
educate her, to fortify and strengthen her for the
battle of life&mdash;a phrase she detested from her mother&#8217;s
frequent use of it&mdash;counted for naught. She was
alarmed to find that she never really reached any
conclusion in attempting to settle her problems.
When she thought she had determined any of the
matters that rose with so malevolent an insistence for
decision some unexpected turn left her still beset by
uncertainties.</p>

<p>Two policemen standing on a corner stopped talking
as she passed and she felt their eyes following
her. They symbolized the power of the law; they
were agents of society, they were representatives of
the order of things against which she had been trying
to persuade herself she was in rebellion. She now
seriously questioned the desirability of being a rebel;
such a status had its disagreeable and uncomfortable
side.</p>

<p>When she reached her room she sat down thinking
she would write her usual daily letter to Trenton;
but with paper before her and a pen in her hand she
was unable to bring herself to it. The disturbance
at McGovern&#8217;s had shaken her more than she liked
to believe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>In her cogitations, as she lay in the dark unable
to sleep, she wondered whether the incident at McGovern&#8217;s
might not be a warning, which she would do
well to heed, to discourage Trenton&#8217;s further attentions.
Trenton might in a similar circumstances behave
no better than Bob had behaved and she was not
anxious to subject herself to the ire of another indignant
wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace</span> was keenly disappointed at receiving no letter
from Trenton the next day. She canvassed all
possible explanations of this first lapse in their correspondence.
Whatever might be the cause she decided
not to write until she heard from him again.
She passed an unhappy morning and was relieved
when Irene asked her to go to lunch. It was possible
that Irene might have some news of Trenton, as
he and Kemp were constantly in touch with each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me I look perfectly all right&mdash;just as though
nothing had happened,&#8221; Irene remarked when they
had given their order.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you want to know, you&#8217;re just a trifle
paler than usual; but I&#8217;d never have noticed it.
What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene answered by holding out her left hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The emerald is no more! Oh, I haven&#8217;t sent it
back! I&#8217;ve just stuck it down in the bottom of a
drawer with a lot of other old junk. It&#8217;s all over,
my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Tommy have quit!&#8221; Grace exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finished, quit&mdash;whatever you like. You&#8217;ll remember
I told you such things can&#8217;t last. Please don&#8217;t
think I wasn&#8217;t prepared! But to a certain extent
Tommy did fool me. I thought he really cared for
me and I won&#8217;t deny that I thought a lot of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is certainly a surprise,&#8221; Grace remarked, noting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
signs of dejection in the usually placid Irene that
had previously escaped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I got a line on him a few days ago. It&#8217;s
a small world and things have a way of getting round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene spoke as one whose philosophy is quite equal
to any demand that may be made upon it. She dilated
upon the general perfidy of man as though
her personal disappointment was negligible and only
to be mentioned for purposes of illustration. She
continued in this vein so long that Grace began to
fear she was not to learn just what had happened to
shatter Irene&#8217;s faith in Kemp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s consider all the male species dead and
buried! I&#8217;m dying of curiosity. Just what happened
to you and Tommy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He lied to me, that&#8217;s all; and I found him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad; I&#8217;m ever so sorry,&#8221; Grace replied,
not knowing whether Irene sought consolation for the
loss of her lover or wanted to be congratulated on
her prescience in foreseeing the inevitable end of the
affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right with me! But I can&#8217;t deny that
when it came it was a jar. You see Tommy&#8217;s mighty
good fun and awfully clever. I learned a lot from
Tommy; he used to tell me everything. I&#8217;ll wager
he&#8217;s sorry now he told me a lot of most intimate
things, about people and business and even his family
affairs; but they&#8217;re safe, I&#8217;d never betray his confidence
even if he has gone back on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; you&#8217;d never do that,&#8221; Grace assented,
and saw that Irene was pleased by this testimony
to her high-mindedness. &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s some
mistake about it. Of course you&#8217;ll give Tommy a
chance to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I gave him the chance all right enough. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
was over the telephone and, my dear, you should have
heard him gasp when I put it up to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on and tell me what Tommy did or let&#8217;s stop
talking about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you. You and Minnie Lawton
are the only people I <i>could</i> tell. I&#8217;ve been meeting
Tommy at Minnie&#8217;s apartment and she has to know
why I&#8217;m not going there any more. Tommy&#8217;s always
told me I was the only one&mdash;that old, old story!
Well, a certain person&mdash;he didn&#8217;t know I knew
Tommy&mdash;was asking me about him the other day.
He said he&#8217;d seen Tommy in Chicago with a very
nifty girl he seemed to be chummy with. He saw
them together last Saturday night. Now, Tommy
had a date with me for Saturday evening but he told
me Friday he was going to Chicago unexpectedly with
his wife for the opera. He didn&#8217;t take his wife to
Chicago&mdash;I easily found that out. Tommy went to
Chi all right enough but not to hear Mary Garden.
So, there&#8217;s the end of our little romance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Tommy have to say for himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>could</i> he say!&#8221; Irene exclaimed disdainfully.
&#8220;He wanted to see me of course; said he could explain
everything, but I said good-bye very sweetly
and hung up on him. I&#8217;d like to see him explain a
thing like that! I suppose he thought he&#8217;d send me
a box of candy and everything would be lovely. I&#8217;m
a good deal of a fool, my dear, but hardly to that
extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t just pick you out to try putting anything
over on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all alike!&#8221; Irene resumed, ignoring Grace&#8217;s
tribute to her perspicacity. &#8220;Men expect women to
take everything. Poor Tommy! If he doesn&#8217;t stop
drinking he&#8217;s going to die real quick one of these days.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
I guess he didn&#8217;t like my lecturing him so much. You
know I was interested in all his plans&mdash;he&#8217;s no end
ambitious and he used to invite my little hints and
suggestions; not that I really know about machinery
or finance, but I suppose I have got a business head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly have, Irene. You&#8217;ll have a big business
of your own some day or a wonderful position
in New York. You could easily swing our department
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I might, but I&#8217;ve almost decided to get
married. Oh, don&#8217;t jump! I mean when I see a
good chance. Now that I&#8217;m done with Tommy the
idea doesn&#8217;t seem so bad. Perhaps,&#8221; she added, &#8220;perhaps
we&#8217;re not fair to marriage! There may be something
in it after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are still people who think so,&#8221; said Grace,
impelled to laughter by Irene&#8217;s gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose we&#8217;ve got to recognize it! How&#8217;s
Ward these days? Still roaming the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In New York the last I heard of him, and terribly
busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, there&#8217;s something pathetic about
Ward Trenton,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;There&#8217;s something away
back in his mind that he tries to hide even from himself!
You know what I mean? It&#8217;s his wife, I suppose.
I saw her picture in a magazine not so long ago
and meant to show it to you. She&#8217;s not at all the
frump you&#8217;d expect from her being an author and
lecturer, but quite handsome and smartly got up.
It&#8217;s certainly queer that a woman like that who has
scads of money and a real man for a husband won&#8217;t
stay at her own fireside, but has to trot around showing
herself off. And Ward&#8217;s fascinating; those quiet
self-contained men are always fascinating. And they
certainly keep you guessing as to what they think.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Take poor Tommy; once he&#8217;s away from business he&#8217;s
got to be amused. But Ward&#8217;s different. That man
does a lot of solid thinking even when he&#8217;s out to
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s kind, he&#8217;s awfully kind,&#8221; Grace murmured.</p>

<p>With the Cummings&#8217;s episode and its very obvious
lesson still playing through her thoughts Grace eagerly
welcomed Irene&#8217;s praise of Trenton, feeling the need
of just the assurances her friend was giving her as
to his fine qualities, which attained a new dignity in
view of Kemp&#8217;s inconstancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward&#8217;s perfectly splendid,&#8221; Irene continued as
though fearing she hadn&#8217;t done Trenton full justice.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had any illusions about Tommy; I always
knew I&#8217;d have to pass him up some day. But don&#8217;t
let me shake your faith in dear old Ward. He won&#8217;t
lie to you; he&#8217;d tell the truth if it ruined him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really think that?&#8221; asked Grace with a slight
quaver in her voice which the watchful Irene did not
miss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I think it! But with two people as intense
in your different ways as you and Ward, you&#8217;re
likely to hurt each other terribly. I&#8217;ve been awfully
careful what I&#8217;ve said to you, Grace, about&mdash;well&mdash;about
going the limit with Ward. But I can see you&#8217;re
not just throwing yourself at his head. And Ward,
if I know him, is not going to expect you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s fine!&#8221; said Grace, averting her eyes. &#8220;No
one could be finer, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear; there&#8217;s that <i>but</i> we always bring up
against! I won&#8217;t say a word about Tommy and me.
Of course I never loved Tommy but I thought he was
a good fellow and on the level; and it was exciting
while it lasted. That&#8217;s what catches a lot of girls who
go in for such little affairs as mine with Tommy. It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the excitement of doing something they know&#8217;s dead
wrong and bound to end in a smash-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Grace was eating little and seemed dispirited,
Irene recurred to Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward would never be satisfied just to play around
with a girl, knowing that whenever he got tired he&#8217;d
chuck her and pick up another. I&#8217;m saying this because
I know he fell for you hard that very first night
you met; it was a clear case of love at first sight with
you two. I&#8217;m not just kidding you; you know as well
as I do you&#8217;re different from other girls. You&#8217;ve got
brains and poise. Not that you weren&#8217;t always a lot
of fun and a good pal,&mdash;I never knew a girl who was
as much fun to play with. But you&#8217;ve always kept
your self-respect and held your head high. Ward likes
that in you because he&#8217;s that sort himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could believe you&#8217;re right but, Irene,
sometimes I don&#8217;t feel I know myself at all! When
I quit college I was full of self-conceit and thought
I had a strong grip on myself. I was going to test
out life&mdash;find out everything in my own way. But
there are times when I get scared. I thought it would
be fun to drift along for awhile, just trying myself
out and I was sure I could stop whenever I pleased
and settle on something. But I&#8217;m not doing it!
What&#8217;s the matter with me anyhow?&#8221; she demanded
mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in love! Don&#8217;t you think I haven&#8217;t been
watching the awful symptoms. You&#8217;ve got a real
case!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean that? Would you really
know?&#8221; asked Grace eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I know? I could see it with my eyes shut.
And I can see it&#8217;s troubling you. These are things
we&#8217;ve all got to settle for ourselves, my dear. And
from what I know of Ward I&#8217;ll wager he&#8217;s taking it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
just as hard as you are. He&#8217;s married and he knows
just what the whole thing means. I&#8217;d be disappointed
in him if he didn&#8217;t give you a good chance to drop
him now even though he suffered terribly. And he&#8217;s
of the kind who do suffer all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be better,&#8221; said Grace soberly, &#8220;if I didn&#8217;t
see him again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be unhappy if you do that. You&#8217;d
both be unhappy. Of course, there&#8217;s his wife. He&#8217;d
be likely to think of her pride and dignity,&mdash;chivalry
and all that sort of stuff. And if he got a divorce
and married you the whole business might be unpleasant.
You&#8217;re not the sort of girl who could go through
a thing like that without suffering terribly. It&#8217;s something
for you to think about, my dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of her trouble with Kemp, Irene was eating
a substantial luncheon. There were times when
Grace felt an aversion for Irene. The most sacred
relationships of life the girl treated with a cold cynicism
that affected Grace disagreeably. She was pondering
the sordidness of Irene&#8217;s liaison with Kemp. The
lofty condescension with which Irene spoke of him
amused Grace only mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be grand,&#8221; Irene continued, &#8220;to be
made love to&mdash;I mean by some one who really knew
how! Somebody who&#8217;d approach you as though you
were a queen and stand in terrible awe of you! The
trouble with all us women nowadays is that we&#8217;re
too easy. The next time a man shows any symptoms
of being interested in me I&#8217;m going to be the coy
little girl, I can tell you! Oh, I&#8217;m not thinking of
Tommy&#8221;&mdash;her lip curled&mdash;&#8220;I mean where the man
really respects you first of all. I tell you, Grace, I&#8217;m
pretty well fed up on this new woman stuff. Believe
me, I&#8217;m staying home with mother these nights knitting
a sweater for father, and Sunday I&#8217;m going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
put on a big apron and bake a cake&mdash;honest, I am!
Women do better as a domestic animal like the common
or fireside cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t really think that!&#8221; Grace exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know Grace, you&#8217;re all for our glorious independence
and fighting in the ranks shoulder to
shoulder with the men. But the trouble is we can&#8217;t
fight <i>with</i> them; we&#8217;re fighting against them every
hour of the day! My dear, there&#8217;s a curse on us&mdash;the
curse of sex! There&#8217;s absolutely no ducking it.
You may talk all you like about equality and how
men and women meet in business and the woman is
the equal of the man. All right! She may have just
as good a head as the man she&#8217;s dealing with but if
she still has home-grown teeth and her face isn&#8217;t painful
to look at sex is all mixed up in the figures. You
can&#8217;t get away from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Irene&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I saw you sell a woman a coat yesterday&mdash;that
old girl from up in the bushes whose husband
came along to keep her from blowing his bank roll,
and it was the man you sold that rag to, not the
woman. Sex! You&#8217;re a pretty girl, you know, and he
spent twice what he&#8217;d let her blow on herself if it
hadn&#8217;t been for your blandishments. And when I
go down to New York on a buying jaunt the polite
gentlemen in our line buy me expensive dinners
and take me in swift taxies to the theatre and
to supper and to snappy dance places afterwards.
That&#8217;s sex! If the store sends a <i>man</i> down there
the same birds buy him a quick lunch and that&#8217;s all.
But a woman&#8217;s different! Sex, my dear, sex!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not as bad as that!&#8221; Grace protested. &#8220;I
want to be considered as a human being first and
as a woman afterwards. I don&#8217;t mind saying that
there have been times lately when I&#8217;ve wished I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
see things as mother does, but I can&#8217;t. There&#8217;s no
use trying to live backwards. I just couldn&#8217;t stay
in a house all the time and cook and sew and darn
for a husband; I&#8217;d go crazy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the home life listens good to me right now!&#8221;
replied Irene with a sigh. &#8220;No; this is my turn
to pay the check. By the way, did you notice that
woman I waited on this morning&mdash;the dish-face with
too much paint and pearl earrings as big as your
fist&mdash;well,&#8221; she broke off abruptly&mdash;&#8220;here&#8217;s a happy
surprise! If I&#8217;m not mistaken here&#8217;s the tall sycamore
of Raccoon Creek!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you talking about&mdash;a raccoon
with pearl earrings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; a certain party just coming in the door.
Looks like your old college chum who took you to the
football game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace turned to find John Moore bearing down
upon their table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>will</i> excuse me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; he exclaimed radiantly
as he shook hands. &#8220;Oh, I remember Miss
Kirby; ashamed of myself if I didn&#8217;t. Well, Grace,
they told me you were up here at lunch so I thought
I&#8217;d take a chance. Hope you&#8217;ve got a minute. I came
to town on particular business. Sold an Airedale pup
and brought him up to make special delivery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a kennel, Mr. Moore?&#8221; asked Irene.
&#8220;I adore Airedales.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s a kennel!&#8221; John answered as he drew
a chair from an adjoining table and seated himself.
&#8220;Grace knows the place; an old barn, one of the professors
let&#8217;s me use for taking care of his furnace.
I&#8217;m selling off my pups now before I move to the
great city. I&#8217;ll be lonesome without a dog when
I come up after Christmas. When I went West last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
summer as an honest farm hand I had to leave my
dogs for a darky to look after and I certainly did
miss them. But I&#8217;ve got twenty-five dollars apiece for
them,&#8221; he concluded, with a frank appeal for their
approval.</p>

<p>He gave Grace the latest news of the university,
explaining his items for Irene&#8217;s enlightenment. When
Grace asked him about particular girls he protested
that he had never heard of their existence. Grace
was just kidding him, he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is, Miss Kirby, since Grace left the
campus I haven&#8217;t seen any girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it,&#8221; Irene replied. &#8220;With Grace
gone there&#8217;s nothing left of the picture but the frame.
She&#8217;s one in a million. You&#8217;ll look a long time before
you find another girl like Grace Durland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said something!&#8221; John affirmed, and pretending
that Grace was not present he and Irene engaged
in a lively discussion of Grace&#8217;s merits. With
Irene this was of course only a device for flirting
with John. John understood perfectly that she was
flirting with him. As this went on John and Irene
were taking careful note of each other. Two natures
could not have been more truly antipodal. Grace was
amused to see them at such pains to please each other.
She interrupted them occasionally with a question as to
some virtue attributed to her, which they feigned not
to hear but answered indirectly.</p>

<p>He was already preparing for his removal to the
city and wore a new suit and hat and carried a pair of
tan gloves which obviously had not been worn. He
struck his hat with them occasionally as he talked.
John had always been quick to note little tricks of
manner and speech and when they pleased him he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
frankly adopted them. His manner of playing with
his gloves was imitated from a young instructor at
the university who carried gloves with him everywhere,
even into the class room, where he played
with them as he heard recitations. John in his new
raiment looked less like a countryman than Grace
had thought possible. She recalled what a cynical
senior had once said of him&mdash;that above the collar
he looked like a signer of the Declaration of Independence
but that the rest of him was strongly suggestive
of the barnyard. His eyes missed nothing;
he was too eager to get ahead in the world not to
study his own imperfections and overcome them.
Having impressed John with the idea that for the
few minutes they spent together he was the only specimen
of the male species in the world, Irene languidly
glanced at her watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only ten minutes to get back, Grace. I&#8217;ll keep
the wheels of commerce turning while you talk to
Mr. Moore. Do forgive me, old things, for keeping
you waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she gathered up her purse and vanity box Moore
protested that he and Grace had nothing to say to
each other which she might not hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t try that on me!&#8221; Irene replied, looking
from one to the other meaningfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you leave us alone John will begin talking
poetry,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;Please wait, I don&#8217;t feel a bit
like poetry today!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Miss Kirby; you see Grace doesn&#8217;t want
to be alone with me! I&#8217;ll tell you what! I&#8217;m staying
in town tonight and it would be fine if we could all
go to a show together. There&#8217;s a picture I&#8217;ve read
about&mdash;&#8216;Mother Earth,&#8217; they call it; said to give a
fine idea of pioneer life. I guess we owe it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
folks who drove out the Indians and cleaned up the
varmints to show &#8217;em a little respect, and they say
that picture&#8217;s a humdinger. If you don&#8217;t like the
notion and there&#8217;s some other show&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were bright with expectancy as he awaited
their decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he added with a broad smile, &#8220;now that
I&#8217;ve sold my last pup and paid my debts I feel a little
like celebrating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you ever so much, Mr. Moore,&#8221; said Irene,
&#8220;but really, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course you can go, Irene,&#8221; exclaimed
Grace, who had not missed Irene&#8217;s look of consternation
when John suggested spending an evening viewing
a movie illustrative of the sacrifices of the
pioneers. However, Irene had quickly recovered from
the shock and seemed to be seriously considering
John&#8217;s invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to go, thank you, John; but of course
we must have Irene!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, we want Miss Kirby,&#8221; John declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you hadn&#8217;t seen me here, Mr. Moore, you&#8217;d
never have thought of asking me. You know you
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly, I thought of it before I came into the
store! Ever since that day you were so nice about
letting Grace off to go to the game I&#8217;ve had a feeling
I&#8217;d like to show you some trifling attention. I&#8217;ll take
it as another favor if you&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you put it that way, Mr. Moore, of course
I accept,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;I must skip; you stay, Grace,
and arrange the little details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty nice of Miss Kirby to go,&#8221; John remarked
as he resumed his seat after bowing Irene
from the table. &#8220;And it must make things a lot easier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
for you to have a fine girl like that to work with. You
can tell she knows her business. I guess nothing&#8217;s going
to rattle her much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do, John; make me jealous?&#8221;
laughed Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Grace, you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>What would John think, Grace wondered&mdash;John of
the high ideals and aspirations, if he knew that it was
only because Irene had broken with a man whose mistress
she had been and in consequence was disposed to
take refuge in things wholly foreign to her nature and
experience, that she had accepted an invitation to
attend a picture show that celebrated the joys and
sorrows of the pioneers!</p>

<p>It was settled that John should go home with her
for supper and that they would meet Irene in the
lobby of the theatre. Grace took occasion to caution
John against mentioning Irene at home. Her mother
and Ethel didn&#8217;t like Irene, she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see but she&#8217;s a pretty fine girl,&#8221; John replied.
&#8220;And it makes a hit with me that she&#8217;s such a
good friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m not going,&#8221; said Irene when Grace
went back to her department. &#8220;I supposed you understood
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly didn&#8217;t. John wanted you or he wouldn&#8217;t
have asked you. You know what you were saying
about sex! Here&#8217;s a chance to prove you can forget
it. Let&#8217;s assume John&#8217;s taking us to a movie merely
because we&#8217;re charming and amusing persons; just
as he might take a couple of young men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I don&#8217;t care anything about going to a show
right now when I&#8217;m wearing mourning for myself, but
I&#8217;d just like to sit near that suitor of yours for an
hour or two. He does me good.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>This was not like Irene, and Grace discounted heavily
her friend&#8217;s admiration for John. It was merely
that Irene was contrasting John with Kemp, in much
the same spirit that she had praised Trenton at the
lunch table.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he knew me for what I am he&#8217;d probably run
like a scared rabbit,&#8221; said Irene, slipping a tape-line
through her fingers. &#8220;I felt myself an awful fraud all
the time I talked to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can always rely on John to think the best of
everybody and everything,&#8221; Grace replied. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
mighty satisfactory sort of person. If I ever got into
trouble I know John would stand by me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; Irene returned. &#8220;A man
with eyes like his is bound to be mighty square. But
when I sat there kidding him about you I did feel awfully
guilty and ashamed of myself. I was afraid
those eyes might see too much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out of the dark!&#8221; exclaimed Grace. &#8220;We&#8217;d
better go to work. John&#8217;s going home to supper with
me and we&#8217;ll meet you in the Pendennis lobby at a
quarter before eight.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The afternoon passed and still no letter from Trenton.
Grace was glad that she had not told Irene
how far Trenton had gone in declaring himself. Not
even Irene should know how much she cared for Trenton.
She indulged in the luxury of self-pity, picturing
herself going through life with the remembrance of him
like a wound in her heart that would never heal. And
after summoning her courage to meet such a situation
she was swept with a great tenderness as she thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of him, remembering the touch of his hand, his kiss
on her lips.</p>

<p>When she called up her mother to say that she was
bringing John home Mrs. Durland reminded her that
this was the night Ethel had asked Mr. Haley to supper.
Grace had been fully informed as to Mr. Haley&#8217;s
acceptance of Ethel&#8217;s invitation but in her confused
state of mind she had forgotten it. Haley was Ethel&#8217;s
discovery and Grace had several times encountered
him in the Durland parlor. Recently Ethel had been
referring to the young man a little self-consciously by
his first name. Osgood Haley was twenty-seven, a
well appearing young man, who was a city salesman
for a wholesale grocery firm. Mrs. Durland had satisfied
herself by inquiries of an acquaintance in the town
in which Haley had originated that he was of good
family and he was thereupon made to feel at home in
the Durland household.</p>

<p>Ethel had met him in her Sunday school where
within a few weeks after taking a class of boys he had
doubled its membership. It was his personality, Ethel
said; and beyond question Haley had a great deal of
personality. Among other items of Haley&#8217;s biography
Ethel had acquainted the family with the fact that
his interest in religion was due to the influence of a
girl to whom he had been engaged but who died only
a short time before the day appointed for their wedding.
Ethel made a great deal of this. Haley&#8217;s devotion
to the memory of the girl he had loved was very
beautiful as Ethel described it, and Mrs. Durland said
that such devotion was rare in these times.</p>

<p>Haley had brought to perfection a manner that not
only had proved its efficacy in selling groceries but was
equally impressive in the parlor. When he shook
a hand he clung to it while he smiled into the face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
its owner and uttered one of a number of cheerful remarks
from a list with which he was fortified. These
were applied with good judgment and went far toward
convincing the person greeted that Mr. Haley
was the possessor of some secret of happiness which
he benevolently desired to communicate to all mankind.</p>

<p>Ethel having gone home early to prepare some special
dishes for her guest, came in flushed from the
kitchen just as Haley arrived with Grace and John,
who had met him on the street-car. Mr. Durland had
meekly submitted to investiture in a white shirt in
honor of the occasion. He had confused Haley with
a young man from Rangerton who sometimes visited
the family. When he had been set straight on this
point they went to the table where the talk opened
promisingly.</p>

<p>Haley needed no encouragement to talk; he was a
born talker. He was abundantly supplied with anecdotes,
drawn from his experience as a salesman, which
proved that a cheery and optimistic spirit will overcome
all obstacles. John provoked him to renewed
efforts by insisting that theoretically the position of
the pessimist is sound. Haley would have none of this.
He had found, he declared, that hope is infectious and
he derived the liveliest satisfaction from his success in
overcoming the prejudice and reluctance of difficult
customers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two boys make a splendid team,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Durland. &#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t know many people
here, John.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only frat brothers and boys who&#8217;ve graduated
from the University since I&#8217;ve been there. There&#8217;s
quite a bunch of them, too, for I&#8217;ve been plugging
around the sacred groves of academe a long time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll be so busy when you move to town
you&#8217;ll have to limit your social life,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;But
we all need outside interests. Osgood has been here a
year but it was some time before he found just what
he needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haley rose to this promptly by saying that being
received in a home like the Durland&#8217;s was the pleasantest
thing that had ever happened to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, John,&#8221; Ethel continued, &#8220;you will find
a church connection helpful. I hope you will hear
Dr. Ridgley before handing in your letter anywhere
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said Haley. &#8220;I tried several
churches before I finally settled on Dr. Ridgley&#8217;s.
He&#8217;s helped me over a lot of hard places just by a word
or two. It just occurs to me, Ethel, that John,&#8221; (Haley
was already calling Moore by his first name) &#8220;would
enjoy Mr. Forman&#8217;s bible class. They&#8217;re all business
and professional men and Mr. Forman is a thorough
Bible student. If I didn&#8217;t enjoy my boys so much
I&#8217;d certainly never miss a Sunday morning with Mr.
Forman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, John, we&#8217;re trying to fix everything up
for you,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland, turning a sympathetic
glance upon Moore.</p>

<p>Grace was unable to recall that she had ever heard
John speak of churches, though in their walks about
Bloomington he had discussed religion in general terms.
She doubted whether, with his many engrossing employments,
he had been a diligent church-goer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them crowd you, John,&#8221; she said, seeing
that he hesitated to commit himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a church member,&#8221; he said diffidently. &#8220;I
suppose I&#8217;m hardly what you&#8217;d call a believer; at least
I don&#8217;t believe all you&#8217;re supposed to believe if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
subscribe to a creed. I hope I&#8217;m not shocking you
folks but it always seems to me there&#8217;s something
stifling about a church. When I was a boy on the
home farm and all the neighbors met at the country
church every Sunday, I always hated to go in; it
seemed a lot cheerfuller outside. I suppose if I got
right down to it I&#8217;d say I believe in a great power
that I haven&#8217;t any name for, that moves the world.
It&#8217;s bigger than any church, and it works in all of us
whether we go to church or not. I suppose if you
got down to bed rock you&#8217;d call me an agnostic. But
I&#8217;m strong for whatever any church does to help people
live right. When it comes to believing a lot of things
I can&#8217;t square with reason I just can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about my own idea,&#8221; ventured Mr. Durland,
who had been bending over his plate with his
usual stolid silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not so far apart, John,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland,
anxious to avert the deliverance which she saw from
the tense look in Ethel&#8217;s face was imminent. &#8220;We
all see things differently these days and I think it
better not to discuss the subject. It&#8217;s far too personal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can say such a thing, mother,&#8221;
said Ethel, with painstaking enunciation. &#8220;I think it
our solemn duty to discuss matters that affect our
souls. If there ever comes a time when I can&#8217;t believe
in God I want to die! I don&#8217;t see how any one can
live without the hope of a better world than this.
Without that nothing would be worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t think I want to destroy any one&#8217;s
faith,&#8221; John replied. &#8220;But for myself I try to keep
tight hold of the idea that it&#8217;s a part of our job to make
that better world right here. And if we do that and
there is a better place after death I don&#8217;t believe anybody&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
going to be kept out of it for not believing
what he can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; began Haley with a deprecatory smile,
&#8220;that&#8217;s exactly where I used to stand! You don&#8217;t need
to feel discouraged about your doubts. If we just
will to believe we can overcome everything. That&#8217;s
the truth, isn&#8217;t it, Ethel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel promptly affirmed his statement, and Mrs.
Durland softened the affirmation out of deference for
John&#8217;s feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I agree with John,&#8221; said Grace; &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to believe a lot of things the church teaches but I
can&#8217;t; I&#8217;m always stumbling over some doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know <i>you</i> called yourself an agnostic,&#8221; said
Ethel severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s necessary to classify myself,&#8221;
Grace replied coldly.</p>

<p>Haley volunteered to lend John certain books which
he had found helpful in overcoming his own doubts.
John listened attentively as Haley named them and
replied that he had read them and when Mr. Durland
asked John if he had read &#8220;The Age of Reason,&#8221; Mrs.
Durland thwarted Ethel&#8217;s attempt to denounce that
work by remarking that she thought they could all
agree that every effort to promote peace and happiness
in the world was worthy of encouragement.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said something there, Mrs. Durland,&#8221; said
John soberly. &#8220;I&#8217;m strong for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that leaves us nothing to quarrel about after
all,&#8221; said Haley, beaming with tolerance.</p>

<p>Ethel resented her mother&#8217;s interference with the
religious discussion just when she was ready to sweep
away all agnostic literature with a quotation. And
she was displeased to find John again exchanging
stories with Haley. She had counted much on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
beneficent exercise of John&#8217;s influence on Grace after
he settled in Indianapolis. Her father was hopeless
where religion was concerned and she had no sympathy
with her mother&#8217;s oft-reiterated opinion that there
was something good in all churches. Her indignation
increased as good cheer again prevailed at the table.
She waited till a lull in the story-telling gave her an
opportunity to ask John, with an air of the utmost
guilelessness, the proportion of women to men in the
University. John answered and called upon Grace
to verify his figures. Grace, familiar with Ethel&#8217;s
mental processes, groped for the motive behind the
question. Her curiosity as to what her sister was driving
at was quickly satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just wondering, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; remarked Ethel
carelessly. &#8220;I suppose I might have got the figures
from the catalogue. Oh, by the way, John, Grace
has spoken of so many of her friends in college I feel
that I almost know them. Just the other day she was
speaking of a Miss Conwell&mdash;Mabel, wasn&#8217;t it, Grace?&mdash;who
must be a very interesting girl. She had her
uncle look Grace up when he was here recently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conwell?&#8221; repeated John, looking inquiringly at
Grace, who sat directly opposite him. &#8220;Do I know
a Miss Conwell?&#8221; he asked and catching a hint from
Grace&#8217;s eyes that something was amiss he added,
&#8220;There&#8217;s such a lot of girls down there I get &#8217;em all
mixed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s from Jeffersonville, you said, didn&#8217;t you,
Grace?&#8221; asked Ethel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeffersonville or New Albany,&#8221; Grace answered,
&#8220;I&#8217;m always confusing those towns.&#8221;</p>

<p>John was now aware that Grace was telegraphing for
help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes;&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I remember Miss Conwell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
I&#8217;d got the name wrong; I thought it was Conway.
I run into her occasionally at the library.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t seem to be in the catalogue,&#8221; Ethel
persisted, &#8220;but that may be because they don&#8217;t know
where she comes from.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haley laughed boisterously at this. John, detecting
a tinge of spite in Ethel&#8217;s pursuit of a matter that
apparently was of no importance, answered that he
thought Miss Conwell hadn&#8217;t taken up her work till
after the fall term opened, which probably accounted
for the absence of her name from the catalogue.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a special, isn&#8217;t she, Grace?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; in English,&#8221; Grace answered, with a defiant
look at her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the girl who&#8217;s related to Mr. Trenton?&#8221;
asked Durland, vaguely conscious that Grace was under
fire. &#8220;I thought that was the name. Trenton,&#8221;
he explained to Moore, &#8220;is a famous engineer. I guess
there&#8217;s nobody stands higher in his line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the husband of that Mary Graham Trenton
who writes horrible books,&#8221; announced Ethel.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s got nothing to do with Trenton&#8217;s standing
as an engineer,&#8221; Durland replied doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess no man has to stand for his wife&#8217;s opinions
these days,&#8221; said John conciliatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t know what Mr. Trenton&#8217;s views
are on the subjects his wife writes about,&#8221; said Ethel.
&#8220;But Grace probably knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t expect me to violate Mr. Trenton&#8217;s
confidence,&#8221; Grace replied.</p>

<p>Fortunately the meal was concluded and Mrs. Durland
rose from the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, John,&#8221; said Grace, when they
reached the street. &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why Ethel
should show her spite at me when we have company.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
She thought with you there it would be easy to catch
me in a lie. It was a nasty trick; but it was splendid
of you to help me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to thank me for that,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;Ethel was sore at me for being a heathen and she
thought she&#8217;d pot us both with one shot. And I guess
she did,&#8221; he ended with a chuckle. &#8220;It would be easy
for her to prove that there&#8217;s no Mabel Conwell at the
University. But why make so much fuss about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just her way of nosing into other people&#8217;s
affairs. If she hadn&#8217;t been so nasty about Mr. Trenton
in the first place I wouldn&#8217;t have had to lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad Ethel&#8217;s got that spirit. It must be
hard living with such a person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene was waiting for them when they reached the
Pendennis. Grace noted that her friend wore her simplest
gown and hat, perhaps as an outward sign of
the chastened mood in which Kemp&#8217;s passing had left
her. John sat between them and their enjoyment of
the picture was enhanced by his droll comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me for the simple life,&#8221; said Irene at the end.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll dream of myself as that girl in the sunbonnet
going down the lane with the jug of buttermilk for
the harvest hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dream&#8217;s as near as you&#8217;ll ever come to it!&#8221;
said Grace. &#8220;I can see you on a farm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be an ideal farmer&#8217;s wife, wouldn&#8217;t I, Mr.
Moore? I&#8217;ve certainly got enough sense to feed the
chickens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you weren&#8217;t doing that you could feed the
mortgage,&#8221; John replied. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see, which one of
you girls am I going to take home first?&#8221;</p>

<p>They went into a confectioner&#8217;s for a hot chocolate
and to discuss this momentous question. Irene lived
in the East End, much farther from the theatre than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Grace. Grace insisted that if he took her home first
she would think it because he wanted to spend more
time with Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be perfectly satisfactory to me!&#8221; said
Irene demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d hate it so much myself,&#8221;
John replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you ever use a taxi, Mr. Moore?&#8221; Irene asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on the price of one Airedale!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he suggested seriously that the whole matter
would be greatly simplified by taking a taxi Irene
would not hear of it. She hadn&#8217;t meant to hint; she
was just joking. They continued their teasing until
they reached a corner where Grace settled the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene wins!&#8221; she cried and before they knew what
she was about she boarded her car and was waving
to them derisively from the platform.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>During the preparation of breakfast the next morning
Ethel apologized for her conduct at the supper
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to speak of that matter at all, Grace.
It&#8217;s none of my business how you met Mr. Trenton.
I don&#8217;t want there to be any hard feeling between us.
I realize that we look at things differently and I want
you to know that before Osgood left last night I made
it all right with him. I told him it was just a joke
between you and me about Miss Conwell. I wouldn&#8217;t
want him to think we spend our time quarreling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he thought it was funny,&#8221; Grace returned.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you that there&#8217;s no such person
as Miss Conwell. John backed me up just because
he resented the way you were ragging me. He knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
perfectly well there&#8217;s no Mabel Conwell at the University.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland entered the kitchen in time to catch
this last remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you know, Grace, that neither Ethel nor I
have any wish to question you about your friends.
I scolded Ethel for asking you about Miss Conwell
before company. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve apologized to Grace, mother,&#8221; said Ethel
meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We assume, Grace,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland, &#8220;that you
mean to hold fast to the ideals we&#8217;ve tried to teach
you at home. We trust you, dear; you know that.
You know all the dangers that a young girl&#8217;s exposed
to and I believe you mean to make something fine and
beautiful of your life. I expect that of both you girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like being pecked at and quizzed,&#8221; Grace
replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to the bacon, Ethel; you needn&#8217;t
bother about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you and John had a pleasant evening,&#8221; said
Mrs. Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s a very good picture. We all enjoyed it.
Irene went with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene Kirby went with you and John to the picture
show!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Durland. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
you said Irene was going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace naturally wouldn&#8217;t mention it,&#8221; said Ethel,
lifting the lid of the coffee pot and closing it with a
spiteful snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dear, let&#8217;s think the best we can of every one,&#8221;
said Mrs. Durland. She had with difficulty persuaded
Ethel to apologize to Grace for questioning her about
the imaginary Miss Conwell and it seemed for an instant
that her efforts to promote harmony were to fail,
now that Grace had mentioned Irene.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;Oh, it happened by accident!&#8221; Grace explained.
&#8220;Irene and I were lunching together at the store
and John strolled in looking for me. And he was
polite enough to include Irene in his invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hardly expect her to do anything as tame as
going to a picture show,&#8221; said Ethel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I&#8217;ve said before, Irene isn&#8217;t as bad as you
paint her. You probably wouldn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d waste
time on John, but they get on famously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John isn&#8217;t quite what I thought he was,&#8221; said
Ethel, ignoring her mother&#8217;s signal for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because he wouldn&#8217;t let you choose a church
for him,&#8221; said Grace, gingerly drawing a pan of corn
muffins from the oven. &#8220;John lives his religion, which
is a lot better than parading it all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Grace, Ethel didn&#8217;t mean to reflect on John,&#8221;
Mrs. Durland hastened to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may give you a better impression of John to
know he&#8217;s been very kind to Roy,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that, Grace?&#8221; asked Mrs. Durland quickly.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t get a chance to ask John about Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John wouldn&#8217;t have told you he&#8217;d been helping Roy
even if you&#8217;d asked him. John doesn&#8217;t advertise his
good works. But I had a letter from one of the girls
the other day and she was teasing me about John.
She said he must be seriously interested in me for he&#8217;d
been coaching Roy in his law work. I call it perfectly
splendid of John when he has so much to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly kind of John,&#8221; said her mother, &#8220;I
wish you&#8217;d told me so I could have thanked him. But
I didn&#8217;t suppose Roy needed coaching. He&#8217;s working
very hard; he&#8217;s sent just scraps of letters all winter
and gives as his excuse that he&#8217;s too busy to write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all got to begin thinking about what Roy
will do after he&#8217;s graduated,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;I&#8217;ve talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
to some of the lawyers who come into our office and
they all say he&#8217;d better go into an office as clerk until
he gets started. A young man can&#8217;t just hang out
his shingle and expect business to come to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad your father isn&#8217;t in a position to help
Roy,&#8221; sighed Mrs. Durland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not let Roy make some suggestions himself
about what he wants to do,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;He&#8217;s got to
learn self-reliance sometime. John Moore hadn&#8217;t anybody
to boost him and he&#8217;s already found a place in
one of the best offices in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Roy&#8217;s case is very different,&#8221; replied Mrs. Durland,
instantly on the defensive. &#8220;John&#8217;s older for
one thing and the hard work he&#8217;s done to get his education
naturally arouses sympathy. I want us all to
make Roy feel our confidence in him. I&#8217;m getting anxious
to have him home. He&#8217;s going to be a great comfort
to me and it will be fine for you girls to have your
brother back. You can both of you do a lot for him.
And, Grace, he can help you solve many of your problems,&mdash;socially
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall want Roy to know all my friends,&#8221; said
Ethel. &#8220;Since I&#8217;ve been with Gregg and Burley I&#8217;ve
made a good many acquaintances among men who
are in a position to help Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy&#8217;s fine social side is bound to be a help to
him in his profession,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;He&#8217;s
always been a friendly boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; Grace replied. &#8220;Roy certainly has
a way of making friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>She refrained from saying that these friends were
not always wisely chosen. She dreaded the time when
he would finish at the University and begin his efforts
to establish a law practice. A good many young men
of the best type of ambitious student had confided in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
her as to their plans for the future and she thought she
knew pretty well the qualities essential to success.
Roy was blessed with neither initiative nor industry,
and she knew as her mother and Ethel did not, the
happy-go-lucky fashion in which he had played
through his college course, and his rebellion against
undertaking the law. It was quite like him to lean
upon John Moore. He must be doing badly or John
would not have volunteered to aid him.</p>

<p>As they ate breakfast, with Mr. Durland dividing
attention between his food and his newspaper, Mrs.
Durland&#8217;s usual attempt to create an atmosphere of
cheer for the day struck Grace as pathetic in its futility.
Hearing her father&#8217;s voice she roused herself to find
that her mother had asked him to look in the market
reports for the quotations on turkeys. Christmas was
approaching and Roy would be home; and Mrs. Durland
was speculating as to whether a turkey for the
Christmas dinner would be too serious a strain on the
family budget. Durland shifted uneasily in his chair
as his wife recalled that they had never been without a
Christmas turkey since they were married. Grace
noting the fleeting pain in her father&#8217;s patient eyes,
hastened to say that beyond question the turkey would
be forthcoming. It was a relief to be out of the house,
walking to the car with her father who was laden as
usual with his notebooks and drawings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER NINE</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">What&#8217;s</span> the difference, lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>The remark she had heard the salesgirl make to the
critical shopper was often in Grace&#8217;s mind. What did
anything really matter! But the aisles at Shipley&#8217;s
were crowded with importunate holiday shoppers, and
she was able to forget herself in her work. She had
been complimented by the superintendent of the store;
she was already one of the most successful saleswomen
in her department. She had earned as high as fifty
dollars a week, not a contemptible sum, even if to earn
it she had become Number Eighteen at Shipley&#8217;s!</p>

<p>Four days passed and still no word from Trenton.
On two nights Grace cried herself to sleep in a confusion
of emotions&mdash;loneliness, fear that some evil had
befallen him, mortification that she had listened to his
protestations of love, and hope that he would yet explain
himself. Her repeated efforts to shut him out of
her mind failed miserably. She had not known until
his communications ceased how much she counted on
him, or how completely he had captivated her imagination.</p>

<p>As she waited for a customer to decide upon a wrap
her gaze fell upon a young woman whom she recognized,
after a bewildered moment of uncertainty, as
Mrs. Bob Cummings.</p>

<p>Briskly summing up the arguments in favor of the
garment her customer was considering, Grace was disagreeably
conscious that Evelyn appeared to be waiting
for an opportunity to speak to her. Grace answered
perfunctorily the last question of her customer
and made out the charge slip. As she concluded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
transaction and bade her customer good morning
Evelyn crossed the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please pardon me, Miss Durland!&#8221; she began, half
extending and then withdrawing her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there something I can show you?&#8221; asked Grace
in her most business-like tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing, Miss Durland,&#8221; said Evelyn and
smiled ingratiatingly. &#8220;You are terribly busy I know,
but there&#8217;s something I want to say to you; it will
take only a minute. I&#8217;m sorry I was so rude the other
night; may I&mdash;apologize?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite unnecessary,&#8221; said Grace coldly, and
was instantly vexed that she had thought of no better
response. Evelyn, embarrassed for a moment, smiled
again. She was much prettier than Grace had thought
her at McGovern&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all so ridiculous!&#8221; said Evelyn, now perfectly
composed. &#8220;Bob&#8217;s such a baby! I didn&#8217;t mind
at all your going out to supper with him. What I
did mind was his acting like an idiot when I walked
in on you. Jimmie was just as idiotic&mdash;the idea of explaining
anything! And then <i>Bob</i> must try to explain!
That bored me just as it bored you. Of
course I wasn&#8217;t going to let him explain! But I&#8217;m
sorry I lost my temper and spoke to you as I did.
Won&#8217;t you forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any forgiving to be done let&#8217;s both do
it!&#8221; said Grace; and they smiled at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men are such fools!&#8221; exclaimed Evelyn, as though
greatly relishing the statement. &#8220;Nothing ever pleased
me more than the way you made Bob take you home.
And then he came back to McGovern&#8217;s and complained&mdash;actually
complained to <i>me</i>!&mdash;that you had
given him the slip! He did that&mdash;really he did! Can
you imagine it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>Her mirth over the affair had communicated itself
to Grace. It hadn&#8217;t occurred to her that Bob might
have returned to McGovern&#8217;s when she left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob is so obvious!&#8221; Evelyn continued. &#8220;He&#8217;s just
got to have sympathy. Really, he wanted <i>me</i> to sympathize
with him because you shook him in the road!
Jimmy and I teased him till he cried for mercy. Bob&#8217;s
a dear boy but he needs just the jar you gave him.
You were perfect! And you won&#8217;t think the worse
of me will you, for losing my temper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; said Grace, &#8220;I&#8217;ve known Bob so
long&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the moment Jimmy spoke your name I knew
all about you, and understood everything. He wanted
sympathy and being a sentimental person he sought
you out of the score of old friendship. Just like him!
Selfish is no name for him! But to think he was afraid
of me! He gave himself away terribly! He&#8217;s so meek
now it&#8217;s positively pathetic!&#8221;</p>

<p>To be laughing over Bob&#8217;s frailties with Bob&#8217;s wife
was something that hadn&#8217;t figured in Grace&#8217;s calculations.
The superintendent, on his way through the
department, frowned to see Number Eighteen neglecting
her duties to chat with a caller, but recognizing
Mrs. Cummings he asked deferentially whether she
was finding what she wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Durland is taking excellent care of me,&#8221;
Evelyn replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m violating all the rules, I suppose,&#8221;
she said when the man had passed on. &#8220;If they
scold you let me know and I&#8217;ll speak to Mr. Shipley
about it. Just one thing more! Bob has told me
about your father and the way Mr. Cummings, senior,
treated him. It wasn&#8217;t fair; Bob says that. I&#8217;d like
you to know I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all in the way of business,&#8221; said Grace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
&#8220;I have no feeling about it; I&#8217;m only sorry for my
father and mother. It was a blow they hadn&#8217;t expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t nice,&#8221; said Evelyn decisively. &#8220;I wish
we could really become acquainted. I&#8217;m going to ask
you up for dinner soon&mdash;please don&#8217;t say no! There
are some young people I&#8217;d like you to meet. Good-bye
and thank you ever so much.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Grace turned to a waiting customer with a kindlier
feeling for all the world. She was uncertain whether
in like circumstances she would have been capable of
the kindness and generosity Evelyn had manifested.
It pleased her to believe that her education in the ways
of the changing, baffling world was progressing.</p>

<p>Evelyn Cummings was evidently a young woman
without illusions; she knew exactly how to manage a
temperamental husband. Marriage, as Grace viewed
it with the three different illustrations afforded by
Kemp, Trenton and Cummings, was of the realm of
insubstantial things. Even the spectacle offered in her
own home by her father and mother, between whom
disappointment and adversity had reared a wall no
less grim because of their steadfast loyalty, was hardly
convincing on the other side of the picture. Stephen
Durland and his wife were held together by habit, by
a deeply implanted sense of duty to their children.
Grace could not remember when her father had kissed
her mother, or in any way manifested any affection
for her. And yet in the beginning they must have
loved each other. She wondered whether it was always
like that!</p>

<p>She had given up all hope of hearing again from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Trenton when on the tenth day she received a note
postmarked New York, that set her heart fluttering.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>My Dear Little Girl:</p>

<p>What must you think of me! I think pretty poorly
of myself, I can tell you. Picked up a cold on my way
East. Pretended it didn&#8217;t amount to anything;
motored down into New Jersey for a week-end with
some old friends. Got chilled on the drive; pneumonia
almost. My host was afraid I&#8217;d die on his hands and
made a frightful row&mdash;couple of doctors, nurse and
all the other frills.... I had no way of letting
you know. Found your letter when I came into town
this morning. I&#8217;m away behind on my jobs....
The great thing is that I want to see you and look
into those dear, dark eyes again.... One day
at twilight down there in the country, I thought of
you so intently that I really brought you into the
room! The nurse was sitting beside the bed, then
suddenly you were there, your dark head clearly outlined
in the dusk. You lifted your hand to touch your
hair&mdash;that&#8217;s a pretty trick you have! You have so
many dear ways&mdash;and you smiled&mdash;another sweet way
you have!&mdash;the smile coming slowly, like a dawn, until
it brightened all the world. The illusion was so
perfect that it wasn&#8217;t an illusion at all, but really you!
I was terribly indignant at the nurse when she turned
on the light and I lost you.... The doctor says
I may travel in three or four days and my thoughts
carry me in only one direction. You haven&#8217;t sent me
the telegram I hoped for; never mind about that.
Please wire me that you are well. And if you put in
a word to say that you want to see me I shall be the
happiest man alive. Be assured of my love always.</p>
</div>

<p>He hadn&#8217;t forgotten her; he really cared! She
moved with a quicker step; her work had never gone
so smoothly. While she had been doubting him, trying
to put him out of her heart he had been ill. She
was unsparing in self-accusation for what now seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the basest disloyalty. She tried to picture the room
to which his longing had summoned her. Those lines
in his letter moved her deeply and set her to speculating
whether such a thing might not be possible in the
case of two beings who loved each other greatly.</p>

<p>There was no intimation in the letter that his wife
had been with him in his illness. Grace grew bitter
as she thought of Mrs. Trenton, who was probably
roaming the world preaching a new social order
to the neglect of her husband. In countenancing
Trenton as a lover Grace found Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s conduct
her most consoling justification. It came down
to this, that if Ward Trenton&#8217;s wife failed in her
marital obligations there was no justice in forbidding
him to seek happiness elsewhere.</p>

<p>This view was in fact advanced in Mary Graham
Trenton&#8217;s &#8220;Clues to a New Social Order.&#8221; It seemed
a fair assumption that Mrs. Trenton wouldn&#8217;t advocate
ideas for all mankind that she wouldn&#8217;t tolerate
in her own husband.</p>

<p>At her lunch hour Grace went to the telegraph office
and sent this message:</p>

<p>&#8220;Greatly troubled by your illness. Please take good
care of yourself. You may be sure I shall be glad to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight telegram, paid,&#8221; the clerk repeated perfunctorily,
and swept the message under the counter.
The sending of the telegram gave Grace a gratifying
sense of kinship with the larger world which Trenton&#8217;s
love had revealed to her. She found happiness all the
afternoon in wondering just what he would be doing
and how he would look when the message reached
him. She wrote that night the longest letter she had
yet written him. She thought often of what Irene
had said about wanting to be loved. To be loved, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
the great way that Miss Reynolds had said was the
only way that counted,&mdash;this had become the great
desire of her heart. Old restraints and inherited moral
inhibitions still resisted her impulse to fashion her
life and give herself as she pleased. She meant to be
very sure of Trenton and even more sure of her own
heart before committing herself further. She was not,
she kept assuring herself, an ordinary or common type.
She dropped into her letter several literary allusions
and a few French phrases with a school girl&#8217;s pride
in her erudition. There were times when Grace was
very young!</p>

<p>Trenton&#8217;s next letter reported his complete recovery.
He was working hard to make up for lost time, but
would leave for the West as soon as possible and hoped
to spend Christmas in Indianapolis. Incidentally he
had business there in which she might be able to assist
him. This was further explained in a typewritten enclosure
which he asked her to deliver to her father.
He warned her that the inquiry might lead to nothing,
but there were certain patents held in Stephen Durland&#8217;s
name which he wished to investigate.</p>

<p>&#8220;The name Durland,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;gave me a distinctly
pleasant shock when the memorandum turned
up on my desk in the routine of the office. There may
be a place where I can use some of your father&#8217;s
ideas; but in this business we&#8217;re all pessimists. I appoint
you my agent and representative on the spot.
Don&#8217;t let your father dispose of any of the patents
described in my letter till we can have an interview.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made the noon hour the occasion for one of
her picnic lunches with her father in his work shop.</p>

<p>He looked up from a model he was tinkering and
greeted her with his usual, &#8220;That you, Grace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much Grace!&#8221; she answered, tossing her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
packages on the bench. &#8220;What are you on today&mdash;perpetual
motion or a scheme for harnessing the sun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fool thing a man left here the other day; wanted
me to tell him why it didn&#8217;t work. It doesn&#8217;t work
because there&#8217;s no sense in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he began to explain why the device was impracticable
she snatched off his hat and flinging it
aside with a dramatic flourish handed him a sandwich.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste your time on such foolishness; we&#8217;re
only interested in machines that work!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sprang upon the bench and produced Trenton&#8217;s
letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let your eye roam over that, old top! And don&#8217;t
tell me you&#8217;ve let somebody take those things away
from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland pondered the letter, lifting the business
sheet closer to his eyes as he examined Trenton&#8217;s
small neat signature. He walked to a closet and extracted
some papers from the confused mass within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, daddy, what&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got those patents all right; they cover my improvements
on my old gas engine Cummings is making.
There&#8217;s already been a fellow nosing round asking
about &#8217;em; from Cummings I guess. I got something
now that&#8217;s going to interest everybody that&#8217;s
making motors; something I been working at two or
three years. Cummings can&#8217;t have &#8217;em. He hasn&#8217;t
got any right to &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes flashed as his hatred of Cummings for the
moment possessed him. Grace had never taken
seriously her father&#8217;s hints that Cummings might have
got rid of him too soon. She had never before seen
him so agitated. He paced the floor, reiterating that
his former associate should never profit by his improvements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
on any of the old Cummings-Durland devices.
He paused, picked up an apple and bit into it
savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, daddy,&#8221; said Grace, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t at all like you
to flare up that way. Mr. Trenton hasn&#8217;t a thing to
do with Cummings; I happen to know that. But he&#8217;s
a business adviser and particular friend of Kemp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kemp!&#8221; Durland repeated, lifting his head with a
jerk. &#8220;You think maybe Kemp&#8217;s interested? Kemp
could use these patents; there isn&#8217;t a thing in these
improvements that wouldn&#8217;t fit right into Kemp&#8217;s
motor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s perfectly grand! Now that you&#8217;ve got your
patents, what you want to do is to sit back and wait.
There must be something pretty good in your ideas or
Mr. Trenton wouldn&#8217;t be interested. Wouldn&#8217;t it be
wonderful if the dollars would begin to roll in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been fooled a lot of times, Grace,&#8221; he answered,
picking up his hat, staring at it as though it
were an unfamiliar thing and clapping it on his head.
&#8220;I guess you better not say anything about this at
home. If it doesn&#8217;t come to anything I don&#8217;t want
your mother disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; it&#8217;s our big secret, daddy. I just
love having secrets with you. After the row at home
the other night about Mr. Trenton&#8217;s niece we&#8217;d better
never mention him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that all about, Grace?&#8221; he asked frowning.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t get what Ethel was drivin&#8217; at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just making herself disagreeable, that&#8217;s all. I
told a fib, but Ethel had no business to attack me
that way before guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethel&#8217;s kind o&#8217; different somehow,&#8221; he said, drawing
the back of his hand across his mouth. &#8220;I guess
she means all right. Funny, you children ain&#8217;t any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
of you alike,&#8221; he went on ruminatively. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
ever seem to get much out o&#8217; Ethel and Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy and Ethel are both fond of you, daddy. And
you know I adore you; I&#8217;m simply crazy about you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pounced upon him and threw her arms about
his neck, laughing at his struggles to avoid the kisses
she distributed over such parts of his face as were
free of grime.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mighty fine girl, Grace. There mustn&#8217;t
anything happen to you,&#8221; he said, freeing himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t be afraid, you dear angel! Nothing&#8217;s
going to happen to me! Here&#8217;s where I skip&mdash;vamoose&mdash;disappear!
I&#8217;m going to take you to a show
tonight&mdash;yes, I am! You be awfully surprised when
I spring it at supper.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Trenton wrote again that he would reach town at
noon of Christmas day and expected to remain a
week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me Ward&#8217;s been sick?&#8221; asked
Irene when Grace told her that he was coming.
&#8220;You&#8217;re certainly the secretive little one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know it?&#8221; Grace demanded. &#8220;You
and Tommy made up?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls were putting up stock at the end of the
day and quiet reigned over the department, broken
only by the voices of gossiping employees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been dying to tell you something all day,&#8221;
said Irene holding up her hand on which the emerald
had been restored to it&#8217;s old place. &#8220;Yes; Tommy told
me about Ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve just taken him back on trial,&#8221; said Irene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
with a sigh. &#8220;Poor Tommy! Minnie got me up to her
apartment last night for supper and who should walk
in but Tommy! He swore that girl in Chi didn&#8217;t
mean anything in his life. He saw her just once when
he had dinner with her and some other people; he was
careful to mention the other people! I believed him
even if he had denied the whole business on the telephone.
Tommy looks terribly pathetic. He&#8217;s going to
die if he doesn&#8217;t check up. His wife&#8217;s gone to California
for the winter, and he&#8217;s drowning his sorrow in
too much booze. Another victim of prohibition!
Tommy&#8217;s one of the million who didn&#8217;t know he had
to have it till they took it away from him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve fixed it up. It&#8217;s much nicer
to be friends with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a friend, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; replied Irene, slowly
shaking her head. &#8220;The poor boy really needs somebody
to keep him straight. From what he said his
wife went away in disgust. Why don&#8217;t these women
stay at home and look after their husbands and not
leave the job to us poor working girls!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene, you&#8217;re a perfect scream! Don&#8217;t make me
laugh like that or we&#8217;ll never get this stuff put away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a laughing matter,&#8221; said Irene, maintaining
her tone of lofty indignation. &#8220;I can tell you right
now that a woman who parks her husband&#8217;s taking
an awful chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before they separated Irene warned Grace that
Kemp had it in mind to drive them with Trenton to
The Shack Christmas afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted us to have dinner out there but I told
him nothing doing. I&#8217;d promised to play with my
family and besides I can&#8217;t let him think I&#8217;m forgiving
him too easy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>On Christmas morning as Grace was helping in the
kitchen John Moore called her on the telephone. He
had moved to town the day before and thought it
would be fine if they could ride to the end of one of the
trolley lines that afternoon and take a tramp. Grace
excused herself with the plea that she already had an
engagement to go to a matinee.</p>

<p>She sang about her work, watching the clock to
mark the approach of the hour of Trenton&#8217;s arrival.
His coming would bring a crisis in her life. The exchange
of gifts in the household, the cheer all the
members of the family were trying to bring to the day
and the train of associations the festival inevitably
awakened touched her; but not as in other years.
There was a difference now. She stood free, self-assured,
confidently seeing in life a great adventure.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible after dinner she flew to her
room to dress, and at half-past two reached Minnie
Lawton&#8217;s, where she found Irene waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy took Ward to The Shack from the train.
They had dinner out there. Tommy&#8217;s car&#8217;s waiting,
so we&#8217;ll prance right along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was disappointed at not seeing Trenton at
Minnie&#8217;s and on the drive to The Shack talked little.</p>

<p>&#8220;You either don&#8217;t want to see him at all, or you&#8217;re
consumed with anxiety,&#8221; commented Irene.</p>

<p>Kemp had given her a thousand dollar bond for a
Christmas present. Her acceptance of the gift she
mentioned without apology. She was going to save
her money, she said in her spacious manner; a girl
who didn&#8217;t put away something for a rainy day was
a fool.</p>

<p>The car was stopped suddenly just inside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
entrance to Kemp&#8217;s farm and Trenton smilingly
opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas! Tommy refused to leave the
fire!&mdash;the poor old salamander! But being of tougher
fibre, here I am to meet you!&#8221;</p>

<p>His unexpected appearance had found Grace unprepared
and she was grateful for the moment his
banter with Irene gave her to adjust herself. He stood
with head bared, the wind ruffling his hair. The
astrakan collar of his overcoat, turned up about his
neck, set off effectively his handsome head and high-bred
face. He was indubitably handsome, a man to
be noticed in a crowd. Grace felt a new pride in the
knowledge that he loved her. She laughed at some
mocking reply he gave Irene and found his gaze upon
her, the grave eyes all tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, get in, Ward!&#8221; exclaimed Irene.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll catch your death standing there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to live forever! Grace, are you shod for
a walk? Then we&#8217;ll let Irene drive on!&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way to a point where the driveway
skirted a woods-pasture, and opened a gate. The
sense of strangeness at being with him again passed
quickly as he began answering her questions about his
illness. He declared that he was too well-seasoned
to be killed by a cold. And besides he had found
that he had something to live for, and that made a
difference. A year before he would have relinquished
his life without regret; now through her he had found
the hope and the promise of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t bear the idea of going indoors until I&#8217;d
had you all to myself a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trees rose tall and black against the bluest of
winter skies. A southwest wind whined fitfully
among the boughs overhead. Grace felt the power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
elemental forces in her blood. She was a free spirit
in a world where the children of men were created of
all time to be free. Through what Trenton was saying
and her replies this thought was dominant. It
lifted her to a mood of exaltation; it seemed that she
could touch the heavens with her finger tips. A
branch of brier caught her skirt and Trenton was
quickly on his knees to free it. He looked up into
her face before he rose and she touched his cheek with
her hand,&mdash;lightly and caressingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make you my true knight,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Arise,
Sir Ward!&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dearest! This is worth waiting for; this is
worth living for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so dear,&#8221; she whispered; &#8220;you are so wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you missed me; have you really thought of
me?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Do I really mean something to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not something, but everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sob in her throat. She clung to him,
laying her cheek to his face, calling him by endearing
names that were new to her lips. &#8220;Sometimes I
doubted you, dear. When I didn&#8217;t hear from you I
thought you&#8217;d forgotten; and it hurt me so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand how that would be,&#8221; he said tenderly.
&#8220;I&#8217;d have let you know if there&#8217;d been any
way. I was afraid to ask my friends to telegraph; it
would have involved explanations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only want your forgiveness. I&#8217;ll never doubt
you again, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have faith in each other; we must trust
each other,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know I&#8217;d trust you round
the world.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>She clasped her arms about his neck and held him
in a long kiss to seal his faith in her. As they went
on she told him about Bob Cummings and the visit
to McGovern&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to give myself a chance to forget you. I
wanted to see if I <i>could</i> forget you. All that day I
had thought of you so steadily that I was unhappy.
I hated the thought of going home and sitting in my
room and thinking of you. Can you understand how
that would be?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she began the story in a tone that was half self-accusation,
half apology, he teasingly pretended to
make something tragic of it, but when he saw that it
was a matter of conscience with her to confess he hastened
to make it easy for her. Assured that he saw
in the episode no disloyalty she gave every humorous
twist to the incident. He laughed till the woods rang
when she described the manner in which she had
slipped away from Cummings and taken the trolley
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m warned now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but don&#8217;t you ever
try running away from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I dare you to
catch me!&#8221; She vaulted the fence into a corn field
and alertly dodged him as he pursued her over the
stubble and among the shocks. She was fleet of foot
and easily outdistanced him. She ended the long
chase by hiding behind a shock and then as he
blundered about seeking her, she sprang out and flung
her arms about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to go to the house,&#8221; he said, glancing at
the lowering sun. &#8220;Tommy threatened to have tea.
We&#8217;ll take another way back; it&#8217;s longer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too bad that things must end? I wish today
could last forever!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s think of it only as the beginning! Today I
refuse to think of anything disagreeable. I only ask
to be sure you belong to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear and splendid one, you don&#8217;t question it!&#8221;
A smile played about her lips and her dark eyes were
afire. &#8220;I love you!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I love you! I
love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The path they were following paralleled the highway
at this point and as they clung to each other a
man passed in the road, walking rapidly toward town.
He could hardly have failed to see their embrace.</p>

<p>It was John Moore, taking alone the tramp he had
asked Grace to share with him. He paused and
stared, lifted his hat and hurried on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace</span> and Trenton had sprung apart as Moore
passed in the highway and they waited in silence until
the sound of his even step over the hard macadam
died away. The romp through the corn field had
loosened her hair and she began thrusting it back
under her hat. Trenton, straightening his tie, looked
the least bit crestfallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was that?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Moore, an awfully nice fellow I knew in
college. He&#8217;s just moving to Indianapolis to go into
the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question but he saw us. It&#8217;s so easy to
forget there are other people in the world! I hope his
seeing us won&#8217;t embarrass you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The only embarrassment
is that I fibbed to him about this afternoon.
He asked me to go walking,&mdash;we did a lot of
tramping at college&mdash;and I told him I was going to a
matinee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you were!&#8221; laughed Trenton; then with an
attempt at carelessness, &#8220;Is he a suitor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, no! But I admire John as every one
does who knows him. He&#8217;s a mighty good friend, and
the kindest soul in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they resumed their walk toward The Shack she
continued talking of John, Trenton manifesting a
sympathetic interest and asking questions to elicit
further anecdotes of Moore&#8217;s varied activities at the
University.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;He may be in love with you,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;You
see I can&#8217;t help being just a little jealous of every
man you knew before you knew me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If John&#8217;s in love with me he&#8217;s very successful in
concealing it!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;No; strange as it may
seem, he likes to talk to me and I&#8217;m proud of his
friendship. He does a lot of reading and thinking.
He&#8217;s a fine character and you&#8217;d be sure to like him.
He&#8217;s leaving the law school to go into Judge Sander&#8217;s
office; the Judge has picked him for a winner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Sanders; he&#8217;s Tommy&#8217;s lawyer. I see
I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye on Moore,&#8221; he went on teasingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure he isn&#8217;t likely to become a dangerous
rival!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I were sure you could be jealous! Maybe
I&#8217;m jealous too! Hasn&#8217;t that ever occurred to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a little frightened at her temerity in asking
a question that was the crystallization of her constant
speculation as to his attitude toward his wife.
There flashed through her mind everything he had
said of Mrs. Trenton, which, to be sure, was very
little though the little required clarifying. She recalled
the apology in his St. Louis letter for having spoken of
Mrs. Trenton at all. In that first talk at The Shack
he had led her to believe that his wife gave him wide
liberty to do as he pleased; but it was conceivable that
a woman might indulge her husband&#8217;s acquaintance
with women she did not know and was not likely to
meet without sanctioning infidelity. Grace had persuaded
herself that there was a distinct difference between
entering into a liaison with a man who still maintained
martial relations with his wife and one who did
not. She was vastly pleased with the moral perception
that showed her this. And she was confident that she
had the will to dismiss him if his explanation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
<i>modus vivendi</i> that existed between him and his wife
should prove to be unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The cowpath they were traversing made it necessary
for them to walk singly and he went ahead, holding
back the boughs that hung over the trail. For a
few minutes she thought he meant to ignore her question
but suddenly he stopped and swung round.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re thinking of,&#8221; he said quietly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of Mrs. Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled a twig from a young maple and broke it
into tiny bits. Grace wondered whether this trifling
unconscious act might not symbolize the casting aside
of such slight ties as bound him to his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve thought of her a great deal. You couldn&#8217;t
blame me for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s wholly natural,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;You
wouldn&#8217;t be the woman I know you to be if you didn&#8217;t.
You have a right to know just what my relations are
with my wife. I&#8217;ll be frank about it. I loved her
when I married her and I believe she loved me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an appeal for sympathy in his eyes, a
helplessness in his tone that was new to her knowledge
of him. It was as though the thought of Mrs. Trenton
brought a crushing depression upon him. Jealousy
yielded to pity in her heart; she was touched with
something akin to maternal solicitude for his happiness.
But she wished to know more; the time had
come for an understanding of his attitude toward his
wife and of Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does love really die?&#8221; she asked almost in a
whisper. &#8220;If you two loved each other once how can
you tell whether the love is dead or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the saddest thing in the world,&#8221; he said, smiling
in his tolerance of her ignorance, &#8220;that love can
and does die. Mrs. Trenton and I meet rarely now;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
but our estrangement came about gradually. I admit
that the fault has been more than half mine. In every
such case there&#8217;s always fault on both sides. When
I saw that her interests were carrying her away from
me, and particularly after she began to be a public
character through her writing and lecturing, I might
have asserted myself a little more strongly&mdash;let her
know that I wanted her and needed her even if the
first passion was gone. But&mdash;you may laugh at this&mdash;I
had old-fashioned ideas that didn&#8217;t square with her
new notions of things. I wanted children and a home
of the traditional kind. Possibly it was in my mind,&#8221;
he smiled wanly, &#8220;that I expected my wife to bring my
slippers and mother me when I was tired. All men are
babies, you know; but all women don&#8217;t understand
that. Probably there&#8217;s where the trouble began. And
I found myself more and more alone as Mrs. Trenton
got deeper into her reform work. She likes the excitement
of moving about and stirring people up. I think
she even enjoys being criticized by the newspapers.
I&#8217;m a peaceful person myself and can&#8217;t quite understand
that. We still keep a house in Pittsburgh but I
haven&#8217;t seen Mrs. Trenton there for a long time. I
doubt whether she any longer considers it her domicile.
When we&#8217;ve met it&#8217;s been by accident or where I&#8217;ve
made the opportunity by going to some place where
she was lecturing. The breach has widened until
we&#8217;re hardly more than acquaintances. She&#8217;s said
that if I ever found a woman I thought I&#8217;d be happy
with to be frank about it. It may be in her mind to
free me if I ask it. I don&#8217;t know. And that&#8217;s the
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t&mdash;you&#8217;re sure you don&#8217;t&mdash;love her any
more?&#8221; Grace asked, uttering the words slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8221;; he answered meeting her direct gaze with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
candor that was a part of his charm for her. &#8220;That&#8217;s
all over. It was over before I met you. But I suppose,
after a fashion, I&#8217;m still fond of her; she was
always interesting and amusing. Even as a girl she&#8217;d
been a great hand to take up with new ideas. When
the suffrage movement developed she found she could
write and speak and I saw less of her to a point where
we began an existence quite independent of each
other. I want you to be satisfied about this; if there&#8217;s
anything you want to know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I believe you and I think I understand. And
I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;very sorry for your unhappy times. I
wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re so fine; so kind, so deserving of happiness!
I want so much to help you find it. I want
to be of real use to you. You deserve so much of
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;do I deserve you!&#8221; he asked softly.</p>

<p>She answered with a look all eloquent of her love,
and kissed him.</p>

<p>When they reached the house they found Irene and
Kemp in the living room engaged in a heated argument
over Irene&#8217;s preemption of a bottle of whiskey
which she had seized to prevent his further consumption
of the contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it, Ward!&#8221; Irene cried, flinging off Kemp&#8217;s
hold upon her arm and handing the bottle to Trenton.
&#8220;Tommy&#8217;s had too much. I&#8217;m going to take him
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme tha&#8217; bottle; gotta have another drink,&#8221;
blurted Kemp, lunging toward Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not another drop!&#8221; said Trenton, passing the bottle
to Grace, who ran with it to the dining room and
told Jerry to hide it. Kemp, caught in Trenton&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
arms, drew back and stared, grinning stupidly in his
befuddlement at the legerdemain by which the bottle
had eluded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy&#8217;s a naughty boy,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;He&#8217;s nasty
when he&#8217;s drunk. Hands off!&#8221; she cried as Kemp again
menaced her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare touch me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not goin&#8217; home. Never goin&#8217; home. Goin&#8217; to
shtay right here,&#8221; declared Kemp, tottering as he attempted
to assume an attitude of defiance.</p>

<p>The Japanese boy had brought in the tea tray and
was lighting the kettle-lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everythin&#8217;s goin&#8217; fine,&#8221; Kemp continued, indicating
the tray with a flourish. &#8220;Have nice chat over
teacups&mdash;hiccups&mdash;tea-cups&mdash;joke, ha, ha! Guests
drink tea; host drink whisk&mdash;key&mdash;thass thirty year
ole, Ward. Can&#8217;t change drinks; always makes me
sick change drinks. Where&#8217;s tha&#8217; bottle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve spoiled everything by getting drunk,&#8221; said
Irene viciously. &#8220;You&#8217;re going home. You know
what you told me the other night at Minnie&#8217;s. Your
doctor&#8217;s warned you to cut out the booze or you&#8217;ll die.
Your heart won&#8217;t stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp turned toward her slowly, opening and closing
his eyes in the effort to comprehend this statement.
He was very white; Trenton was watching him with
deep concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; the matter with me. Jus&#8217; foolin&#8217; &#8217;bout
doctor. Hadda get lil&#8217; sympathy out o&#8217; Irene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put you to bed, Tommy,&#8221; said Trenton. &#8220;A
nap will pull you out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No y&#8217; don&#8217;t, Ward, old man! Not slippy; not bit
slippy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a dinner engagement in town at seven
and I&#8217;ve got a date myself,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
him home. The chauffeur will look after him. There&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
no use letting him spoil the day for you and Grace.
You came out in the runabout, didn&#8217;t you, Jerry? Jerry
can walk over to the interurban when he&#8217;s ready to go
and you two can take your time about going in. You
can manage the runabout, can&#8217;t you, Ward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy enough,&#8221; Trenton replied, frowning in
his perplexity as he eyed Kemp, who had stumbled to
a chair where he sat breathing heavily. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t
like your going in alone with Tommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene bent over Kemp and drew a phial from his
pocket. She shook out a tablet and placed it in his
mouth. The vigilant Japanese boy was ready with a
glass of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strych-ni-ah,&#8221; explained Kemp with a drunken
grin. &#8220;How you come think o&#8217; that, Irene? First aid
&#8217;n all that sor&#8217; thing. Givin&#8217; me poison; thass wha&#8217;
she&#8217;s doin&#8217;. Forgot I had tha&#8217; stuff in my pocket.
Awfu&#8217; funny. Doctor cut off whiskey and gimme rat
poison. Mos&#8217; singular. Mos&#8217; incomree&mdash;in-com-pre-hens-ble.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay back in his chair and threw out his legs,
wagging his head as he laughed inordinately at his
lingual difficulties. When Trenton tried to feel his
pulse he good-naturedly resisted. He was perfectly all
right; never felt better in his life, he declared.</p>

<p>The question of his immediate return to town was
peremptorily settled by Irene, who rang for the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;His heart&#8217;s certainly doing queer things,&#8221; said
Trenton. &#8220;It would be better for us all to go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll come out of it. It&#8217;s nearly dark and I&#8217;ll
open the car window and give him air. Craig&#8217;s driven
him for years and he&#8217;ll look after him at home. I&#8217;m
sick of this business. If he wants to kill himself let
him go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He oughtn&#8217;t to be left alone at home,&#8221; said Grace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;d better go in with him, Ward, and see that he
has the doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind,&#8221; said Irene decisively.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been through this before and his heart
kicking up this way doesn&#8217;t mean anything. Alcohol
hits him quick but it doesn&#8217;t last long. He really
didn&#8217;t have enough to make a baby tipsy. But he
never learns that he can&#8217;t stand it. You two just forget
all about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Craig, the chauffeur, came in with Kemp&#8217;s coat and
they got him into it; but Kemp played for delay.
His dinner engagement was of no consequence; he
insisted that Irene could go alone if she pleased;
she was a quitter and above all things he hated
a quitter. His engagement to dine was at the
Isaac Cummings&#8217;s, and the fact that he was asked
there called for an elaborate explanation which he
insisted on delivering from the door. People were always
boring him by asking him to do things when his
wife was away, from a mistaken idea that a man alone
in town is a forlorn and pitiable being, subject to the
wiles of people he cares nothing for and in normal circumstances
avoids. He warmed to the work of abusing
Cummings; it was an impertinence on the part
of his business competitor to invite him to his house.
The Cummingses were climbers; his wife detested Mrs.
Cummings, and if she had been home he wouldn&#8217;t have
been trapped into an engagement of which he now profoundly
repented; and besides the dinner would be
dry; he would never be able to sit through it. The
insistence of the others that it was a formal function
and that it was too late to withdraw his acceptance
aroused him to an elaborate elucidation of the Cummings&#8217;s
offer of hospitality. Cummings was hard up;
he had sunk a lot of money in oil ventures. Kemp recited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
a list of Cummings&#8217;s liabilities, tracing imaginary
tables of figures on the wall with an unsteady finger
and turning to his auditors for their concurrence in
his opinion that Cummings was on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Playin&#8217; up to me; thinks Tom Kemp&#8217;s goin&#8217; help
him out! Poor boob&#8217;d like to merge&mdash;merge his business
with me&mdash;me! No y&#8217; don&#8217;t, Mr. Cummings!&#8221; he
bowed mockingly to an imaginary Cummings. The
bow would have landed him on the floor if Trenton
hadn&#8217;t caught him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jes&#8217; foolin&#8217;; don&#8217; need to hol&#8217; me, Ward,&#8221; he said,
straightening himself. &#8220;Goin&#8217; home ri&#8217; now. Miss
Kirby take my arm! Guess I know my manners;
or&#8217;nary courtesy due lady &#8217;nevery part th&#8217; worl&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene steadied him to the car, and after Craig had
lifted him in he waved his hand to Trenton and Grace
with an effort at gaiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;House all yours, Ward; make y&#8217; present ole Shack.
Burn it down; do&#8217;s y&#8217; please. Jerry&#8217;ll give y&#8217; anythin&#8217;
y&#8217; want&mdash;wine &#8217;neverythin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Grace and Trenton watched the car turn the long
bend toward the highway and hurried back to the
fire of hickory logs that crackled merrily in the living-room
fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for tea!&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;I ate a huge dinner
but our tramp&#8217;s given me a new appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down before the tray while he stood by the
hearth, resting his elbow on the mantel-shelf, watching
her. Jerry asked if he should turn on the lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, no, Jerry;&#8221; Grace answered. &#8220;The
fire gives light enough. No; don&#8217;t trouble about dinner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
You might give us some sandwiches with our
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a broad smile on Trenton&#8217;s face as he
took his cup and sat down near her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke, Ward?&#8221; she asked. She was now
finding it easy to call him Ward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a joke; I was just admiring your manner
of addressing Jerry. It was quite perfect. He was
greatly impressed by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, was that it! What did you expect me to do&mdash;snap
at him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I was only thinking how charming you&#8217;d be
as the lady of a great house. Your slaves would worship
you. Jerry caught the idea too; I never saw
him bow so low.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerry&#8217;s adorable,&#8221; she murmured, her eyes flashing
her appreciation of Trenton&#8217;s compliment. &#8220;But,
really I must look awful; my hair&#8217;s in a mess. I&#8217;ll run
upstairs and give it a smoothing as soon as we&#8217;ve had
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t! I like it that way. The dark frame
for your face adds a charm that&#8217;s bewildering!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Tommy mean about Cummings?&#8221; she
asked presently. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the Cummings business prospering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy must know what he&#8217;s talking about.
He never quite loses his head even when he&#8217;s
drunk. These are anxious times and it&#8217;s quite possible
that Cummings is hard up. Tommy can afford
to feel easy because he&#8217;s well off even without his
manufacturing business. I&#8217;ve got to do something
about Tommy, though,&#8221; he went on thoughtfully.
&#8220;His New York doctor told me he&#8217;ll have to stop his
monkey shines or something unpleasant will happen
to him. While I&#8217;m here I&#8217;m going to try to get him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
to submit to treatment. But he&#8217;s not easy to manage&mdash;frankly
says he prefers a short life and a merry one.
We&#8217;ve got to save Tommy if we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled a little sadly. Grace liked the way he
talked of Kemp and listened attentively while he gave
many instances of Tommy&#8217;s kindness and generosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;About your father&#8217;s improvements on the motor,&#8221;
Trenton continued, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go into that while I&#8217;m here.
From the claims of the new patents it would appear
that he&#8217;s got something of real value; but we&#8217;ll have
to give them a try-out. We can do that at Kemp&#8217;s
shop. Of course Tommy will be anxious to get the
new ideas if they&#8217;re practical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even a small success just now will mean so much
to father,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;He was greatly excited by
your letter and had to be convinced that you weren&#8217;t
acting for Cummings. He pretends to mother that
there was nothing unfair in Cummings&#8217;s treatment of
him, but deep down in his heart he&#8217;s terribly bitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A fire makes for intimacy and their concord was
now so complete that silence had all the felicity of
speech. The perfect expression of love may be conveyed
in a glance and from time to time their eyes
met in communications too precious for words.
After these mute periods the talk would ripple on
again unhurriedly as though they were the inheritors
of immeasurable time.</p>

<p>In moments of animation when her dark eyes
flashed and she smilingly invited his response she disclosed
new and beguiling charms. In its disorder her
hair emphasized what Irene was fond of calling
Grace&#8217;s gypsy look.</p>

<p>The tea disposed of, she sent away the tray and as
his cigarette case was empty she filled it from a box
Jerry found for her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>&#8220;It seems funny to be using other people&#8217;s things
this way,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;It&#8217;s like finding a house
in perfect running order on a desert island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what a joy it is to be waited on in
this fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up at her fondly as she stood beside him.
When she returned the case he drew her upon his
knees, took her hand and scrutinized it closely. He
pressed a kiss upon the palm and closed his fingers
upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will you keep it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hand?&#8221; she asked provokingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; what I&#8217;ve just put into it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t need to keep that, do I? Won&#8217;t there
be some more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Millions!&#8221; he replied and clasped her tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hands are finely shaped and interesting,
Ward. Oh, you have a double life line! You&#8217;ll never
die! The Mount of Apollo is wonderfully developed&mdash;don&#8217;t
you see it, right there? Of <i>course</i> that&#8217;s what
that is. It&#8217;s plain enough why music affects you so.
You really might have been an artist of some kind
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>This called for an argument in the course of which
she got illuminative glimpses of him as a boy who
was always interested in machinery. He had been
predestined to the calling he had chosen but confessed
that sometimes he wished that he had tried his hand
at executive work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may do it yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have opportunities
occasionally, which I&#8217;m probably foolish to let pass, to
take hold of big concerns. But I&#8217;ve liked my freedom
to roam. It&#8217;s helped solve my problem to be able to
wander.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand, dear,&#8221; she said softly, stroking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
his hair. She knew that by his problem he meant his
wife. Though she had accepted as sincere his explanation
of his relations with Mrs. Trenton, she resented
in spite of herself even this remote reference to
the woman whom she had never seen but had constantly
tried to visualize.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might even move to Indianapolis one of these
days,&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;I have a standing offer from
Tommy to come and help him run his plant. I tell
him it&#8217;s his game to wish his job on me so he can
have more time to play. And Tommy doesn&#8217;t need
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew from his waistcoat pocket the locket that
had so aroused her curiosity at their first meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in this, Ward?&#8221; she asked, holding up the
round gold trinket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>that</i>!&#8221; he said, frowning at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so cross! Must I tease you to show me
what&#8217;s inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she dangled it at arm&#8217;s length he encouraged
the idea that its contents were secret by snatching it
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the darkest of mysteries. What will you give
me for a peep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might give you one kiss,&#8221; she said, deliberating,
&#8220;if I like what&#8217;s inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I must have three!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed. But don&#8217;t show me if you don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a great concession, a privilege reserved
only for royalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the locket guardedly, so turning it as to
conceal the inner surfaces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment, please. Do you stand by the bargain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>He gave it to her, laughing at her disappointment
at finding it empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fraud!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;How long has it been
empty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really want to know?&#8221; he asked, suddenly
grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but not if you&#8217;d rather not tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t give the exact date, but you can approximate
it for yourself. Do you remember the first time
I wrote you&mdash;from St. Louis? It seems aeons ago!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ll never forget that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that night I took out and destroyed a little
photograph I&#8217;d carried there for a good many years.
I&#8217;ll leave you to guess why I didn&#8217;t care for it any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife&#8217;s picture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I bought the locket right after we were engaged
and the picture had been there until I took it
out that night in St. Louis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me more about how you came to take it out,&#8221;
she asked with the insistence of a child demanding the
continuation of a story. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t it have any kind of
meaning for you any more,&mdash;not even little associations&mdash;memories&mdash;you
wouldn&#8217;t lose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it was as though something had died in me
and utterly ceased to be. I was wondering about a
lot of things that night. After I had written to you
I wrote a letter to Mrs. Trenton. She had said from
time to time that if I ever found myself interested in
another woman not to be afraid to tell her. I don&#8217;t
know how seriously she meant that. Odd as it may
seem, I don&#8217;t <i>know</i> Mrs. Trenton! I used to think I
did but that was sheer conceit on my part. As long
as she had made that suggestion&mdash;about telling her if
I met a woman who really appealed to me more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
she did&mdash;I thought I&#8217;d tell her about you. Oh, I didn&#8217;t
tell your name nor where you live!&#8221; he exclaimed
seeing the look of consternation on Grace&#8217;s face. &#8220;My
agreement with her was half a joke; in later years I&#8217;ve
never quite known when to take her seriously. I
suppose I wrote her more to feel her out as to whether
she might not have reached the point where it would
be a good thing to quit altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Grace asked, &#8220;what did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so far her only answer has been a magnificent
silence! The philosophers agree, don&#8217;t they, that a
woman doesn&#8217;t always mean what she says? But a
silence is even more baffling. What would you say
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little ominous&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Contempt, disdain, indifference? Maybe she&#8217;s just
awaiting further advices, as we say in business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly she never got the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s conceivable; she&#8217;s a fast traveler; the mails
have hard work to catch up with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t really know whether she got the letter
or what she would have written if she received it.
Maybe she&#8217;s just waiting for a chance to talk to you
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in any event we needn&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; said
Trenton with a shrug. She rose and drew up a low
rocker and sat beside him, facing the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have seen your letter,&#8221; said Grace,
musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her you kissed me. Like a brave man I put
the responsibility on you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that wasn&#8217;t fair!&#8221; she cried hastily. &#8220;It would
be sure to give her a bad impression of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I intimated that it was only such a kiss as
a daughter might bestow upon a father she didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
think so badly of! I shall always be glad that our first
kiss was like that; we&#8217;ve traveled a long way since
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every step has been so dear,&#8221; she said contentedly.
&#8220;I think I could never forget one single thing. I
don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve forgotten a word you&#8217;ve ever said to
me. And when you were away I lived our times all
over again. And I like to imagine that we talk to each
other by our own private wireless even when you are
miles away. I think I can imagine just what you
would say and how you would look when you said it.
Oh,&mdash;&#8221; she bent forward quickly and grasped his
hand in both of hers; her lips quivered and there was
a mist in her eyes. &#8220;Oh!&mdash;I wish I didn&#8217;t love you so
<i>much</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it occurred to you,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that we&#8217;re
alone away out here in the woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel a bit lonesome; I&#8217;d never be afraid
anywhere with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire had burned low and she watched admiringly
his manner of replenishing it. He used the
shovel to push back the ashes and bring the embers together
in a neat bed, in the center of which he dropped
a fresh log with calculated accuracy. It was his
scientific mind, she reflected, habituated to careful
planning even in unimportant things. He stood for a
moment inspecting his work; moved the log a trifle;
watched attentively the effect of the change, and as
the dry loose bark broke into flame brushed the hearth
neatly and smiled into her eyes as he found her at
his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do everything just right! I love to see you use
your hands,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;re so strong and skillful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to know something about fires; I&#8217;ve made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
enough of them. As a young fellow I did a lot of jobs
that took me into remote places, surveying and construction
gangs; and I&#8217;ve camped a bit&mdash;hunting and
fishing. I might even say that I can make coffee and
fry bacon without utterly destroying their food
values.&#8221;</p>

<p>She established him before the fire in the most comfortable
chair in the room and sat at his feet. With
her arms folded upon his knees to make a resting place
for her head she listened with the rapt attention a
child gives to a beguiling chronicler as he told how he
was lost for three days in the Canadian wilds, and of
a flight by canoe on a stormy night to fetch a doctor
for one of his party who had fallen ill. He had given
her from the first a sense of far horizons, and tonight
her fancy perfected every picture his narratives
suggested of hills and woodlands and streams. They
constituted a new background against which she saw
in him an heroic figure equal to any demand that
might be made upon his strength and courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of these days,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;We must do the
Canadian Rockies together; and then I&#8217;d like to take
you to some places I know in Maine&mdash;just guides and
canoes and <i>us</i>; and I want to do India before I die,
but not without you. You&#8217;re in all my future! I want
to live a long time to enjoy life with you. Does that
appall you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was gazing wide-eyed into the fire, her dark
eyes the harbor of dreams, and he laughed and bent
forward to touch her cheek and break the spell that
bound her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should love it <i>all</i>, dear!&#8221; she said with a happy
sigh. &#8220;To be with you, to share everything with you!
Oh, that would be more happiness than I could bear!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;You do love me; tell me, dear, once more, that
you do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than all this earth and the stars! More
than all the other universes beyond this one!&#8221; she
cried, laughing at her extravagance.</p>

<p>He raised his hand and bade her listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the wind changed awhile ago. The
weather spirit&#8217;s abroad. Let&#8217;s have a look.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw on the porch lights and opened the front
door. It was snowing hard; the porch steps and driveway
were already covered, and the nearest trees had
been transformed into ghostly sentinels. She clapped
her hands in delight at the beauty of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me think of &#8216;Snow Bound,&#8217;&#8221; she said when
they had gone back to the fire. &#8220;I used to know some
of that poem. Little Grace will now recite for you!&#8221;
She assumed the attitude of a school girl recitationist
and repeated, gesturing awkwardly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;What matter how the night behaved?</div>
<div class="verse">What matter how the north-wind raved?</div>
<div class="verse">Blow high, blow low, not all its snow</div>
<div class="verse">Could quench our hearth-fire&#8217;s ruddy glow.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>I&#8217;m talented; you can see that! What if we
should be snowed in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if we should!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Tommy always
carries a full larder and we wouldn&#8217;t starve to
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>With her hands clasped before her she gazed down
at the flames. He drew his arm about her waist and
the room was silent save for the cosy murmur of the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not stay here all night? Jerry hasn&#8217;t left and
he&#8217;ll spend the night if I ask him and give us breakfast.
I suppose you have to go to the store tomorrow?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;&#8221; the assent was to one or all of his questions
as he might choose to interpret it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go in of course, early in the morning. I
have a nine o&#8217;clock engagement myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be expecting me at home,&#8221; she said, pondering
deeply, &#8220;but if I could telephone from
here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Tommy&#8217;s connected direct with the city
exchange. Jerry can tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rang for Jerry, who confirmed his impression
as to the telephone connection.</p>

<p>Trenton detained the boy to ask for more logs
while Grace went to the pantry to telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you going into town tonight, Jerry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Trenton; too complete snowing. I very
well stay all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The runabout&#8217;s in order, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yezzah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Durland and I are spending the night. If
you could give us breakfast, Jerry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With much ease, Mr. Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenton lit a cigarette and smoked meditatively
while Jerry noiselessly filled the wood box. Grace
reappeared as Jerry stood awaiting further instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Grace, what time shall we say for breakfast?&#8221;
Trenton asked casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be at the store at eight-thirty,&#8221; she answered
from the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then breakfast at seven? We&#8217;d better allow a
little extra time in case the snow keeps up. Seven it
is, Jerry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy left them and could be heard moving
about upstairs. A clock struck ten and Trenton exclaimed
at the hour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d have guessed it wasn&#8217;t more than eight! The
hours do jump along when the heart&#8217;s light. Any
difficulty about not going in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not at all. Every one was out but father and
I merely said I was at the house of a girl friend and
would spend the night there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked to a table and began inspecting the
books that were arranged upon it in careful order.
It might have seemed that she wished to avoid meeting
his eyes immediately. He hesitated a moment then
crossed to her quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always interesting to see what books you find
in a country house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a mistake to
judge the owner by the literature you find lying about;
it&#8217;s usually the discards of the guests. At the place
where I caused so much disappointment by not
dying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t say it, even as a joke, Ward!&#8221;
she pleaded, dropping a book she had opened and laying
her hands on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t then! I was jealous of that book.
You were so absorbed I almost felt that I was alone
in the room. And I was horribly oppressed by the
general vacancy, emptiness, voidness! Now my vanity
is touched to find that you hadn&#8217;t really gone away
and left me; you&#8217;re very much here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so foolish!&#8221; she said. &#8220;What were the
books you found in your room at that place where
you were ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they were on the occult and had been left
behind by some enthusiastic spook hunter. After
that hour when I so plainly saw you right there by
my bed I studied those books carefully. I wanted to
explain the transformation of a very plain nurse in
spectacles into the most beautiful girl in the world!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>&#8220;And,&mdash;did you explain it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but not from the books!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was it then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart did the explaining. I knew I loved <i>you</i>!
That&#8217;s the answer to all my questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do love me, Ward, really and truly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; and then with head lifted he added as
though repeating a pledge from some ritual: &#8220;With
all my heart, with all my soul, with every hope of
happiness I have for the future, I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and held her so that he
could look down into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be everything to you; I want to fill your
heart so that you will turn to me in every need. I want
you, all or nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips parted tremulously, inviting his kiss. She
felt singularly secure and content in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;All or nothing?&#8221; she repeated in a low whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! There was no escape for us from the beginning,&#8221;
he said slowly. &#8220;It&#8217;s been like a drawing
of the tide that no man&#8217;s hand could stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked slowly to the hearth, his hands thrust
deep into his coat pockets. He eyed the fire critically
and rearranged the half-burnt logs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;d better put this up as a precaution,&#8221; he remarked
lifting the wire screen that stood against the
wall and laying it against the arch under the mantel.
&#8220;Run along, dear. I&#8217;ll see to the locking up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went into the hall and snapped on the lights
and kissed his hand to her as she started up the
steep, old-fashioned stair. The lights were turned on
in all the rooms and humming softly she wandered
through them, pausing finally in one in which a suitcase
lay open on a chair, evidently placed there by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Jerry. She recognized it as Irene&#8217;s, kept at The Shack
for occasions when she spent the night there.</p>

<p>Below, Trenton was testing the fastening of the
doors. She lifted her head, listening intently as she
heard his step.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>As she dressed the next morning Grace saw a white
world reluctantly disclosing itself in the gray dawn.
Trenton was already gone, and hearing the scraping
of a shovel she looked out and saw him clearing a
path that led to an old barn which Kemp had converted
into a garage. Jerry darted out of the kitchen
to remonstrate and Trenton ceased from his labors
to fling a shovelful of snow at him.</p>

<p>When she went down Trenton met her in the hall,
kissed her and led her with mock ceremony to the
dining room door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast for two! Something awfully cozy about
that table, with the plates so close together!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just perfect! I&#8217;d like to take a run through the
snow; wouldn&#8217;t it be jolly! And there&#8217;s that hill we
climbed yesterday that would be a grand place for
coasting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No time for that now!&#8221; he replied looking at his
watch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a good six inches of snow and
being out so early we&#8217;ll have to be pathfinders.
It will be about all we can do to hit Washington street
by eight-thirty. There&#8217;s going to be waffles and maple
syrup for breakfast. I got that out of Jerry; also
bacon and guaranteed eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Olympians had nothing on us!&#8221; she replied in
his own key of gaiety.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;Oh, we are become even as the gods!&#8221; he cried,
drawing out her chair. &#8220;This is a touch&mdash;breakfast
by candlelight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tall candles in glass holders lighted the table.
Grace for a fleeting moment thought of the kitchen
at home, where her mother and Ethel were now preparing
breakfast, wholly ignorant of her whereabouts.
Trenton saw the smile waver and leave her face, and
he bent over and laid his hand on hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know&mdash;No! you don&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t know what
all this means to me! I feel as though I&#8217;d been dead
and come to life again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it mean so much, dear?&#8221; she asked, her eyes,
intent and searching, meeting his.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you look at me like that, dear,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never be able to finish this grapefruit!&#8221; Then with a
quick change of tone he asked anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not unhappy, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s just the strangeness of being here; that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem real to me, either. I&#8217;d thought so
much of just such an hour as this, facing a new day
and a new world with you, that it&#8217;s hard to believe
the dream has really come true!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll be going away. There will be lots of
times I can&#8217;t see you. It&#8217;s going to be hard to get
used to that,&#8221; she said pensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry on that score. I&#8217;ve got a lot of work
laid out for the next year right here in the Middle
West. I can easily spend my Sundays in Indianapolis.
I&#8217;d travel a mighty long way just for a sight of you.
Let&#8217;s make the most of today and not worry about
tomorrow. Sufficient unto the day is the happiness
thereof!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>She smiled her acquiescence in this philosophy, was
again buoyant, and joined with him in praising Jerry
as the boy appeared with a plate of fresh waffles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what I&#8217;ll do!&#8221; exclaimed Trenton suddenly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut all my engagements for today if you
will and we&#8217;ll stay right here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it would be wonderful! But I mustn&#8217;t even
think of it! I&#8217;d lose my job; and besides, I mustn&#8217;t
forget I have a family. Please don&#8217;t try to persuade
me. But you know I&#8217;d love to stay&mdash;not just today
but forever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you didn&#8217;t have your job!&#8221; he said, frowning.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel comfortable about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t begin telling me I ought to be doing something
different! Everybody else does! I really enjoy
my work at Shipley&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ought to be some way,&mdash;&#8221; he began.
Something in her look caused him to pause. &#8220;I was
going to say that I don&#8217;t like the idea of your working&mdash;you
must let me&mdash;now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dear,&#8221; he said contritely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe in work,&#8221; she went on quickly. &#8220;I mean
always to do something; maybe not just what I&#8217;m doing
now, but&mdash;something!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you talk that way I feel as though you
didn&#8217;t expect to belong to me always.&#8221; He rose and
drew her to her feet. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have that understood
here and now.&#8221; He held her away, his hands resting
lightly on her cheeks as he looked into her eyes with
mock severity. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to be on our way in about
two minutes, Miss Durland, and there must be no
nonsense about this. Is it for always?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for always,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the very end?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>&#8220;Yes, to the very end,&#8221; she assented soberly, and
there was the foreshadowing of tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what may happen; no matter if there
should be times of separation beyond our control&mdash;you
will still love me and trust me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;always. There will never be any one else for
me but you,&mdash;not if I live a thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her arms about his neck and kissed him,&mdash;a
kiss without passion, on forehead and lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care less for me,&mdash;now?&#8221; she asked, and
pressed her face close to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace!&#8221; he cried, catching her wrists and looking
into her eyes. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think that of me! I&#8217;d
be a beast&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her hand over his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dear,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;If I didn&#8217;t
trust you I couldn&#8217;t love you; and I just,&mdash;I
thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest little girl!&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The sun came out of the mists as they set off for
town with the snow flung up by the rear wheels of
the car whirling behind in a miniature storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not afraid of a little speed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with you!&#8221; she answered happily. &#8220;Was that
the right answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One hundred per cent correct! Look at the smoke
from that farmer&#8217;s chimney&mdash;it goes up as straight
as a column. Not a breath of air!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dear good old world,&#8221; she said, her eyes reflecting
her enjoyment of the swift rush between the
long stretches of white level fields broken by patches
of woodland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the dearest thing in all the world?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong that time! It&#8217;s you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how many lovers have said just that to
each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thousands&mdash;billions, no doubt. But that doesn&#8217;t
matter. It never was as true of the others as it is
of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not conceited or anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; just happy! Honestly and truly, are <i>you</i>
happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enormously! Are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right up to the perishing point!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then <i>why</i> are you happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the dearest girl in the world loves me!&#8221;</p>

<p>They laughed their delight in this interchange,
stopped to extricate from its difficulties a car which,
unprovided with skid-chains, had landed in a ditch,
and hurried on to make up for lost time. It was with
a sense of disillusionment that Grace saw the city, as
it seemed, coming out to meet her. Trenton was
talking of his day&#8217;s appointments, of the men he expected
to see. Grace&#8217;s thoughts flew ahead to the
store, where she would meet Irene&mdash;meet her friend
with a new self-consciousness&mdash;and of the deceptions
and evasions that would be necessary to explain her
night&#8217;s absence at home. But these thoughts were
fleeting. She was happy in the confidence that the
man beside her truly loved her and her love for him,
which she had so often challenged and questioned
even after she first encouraged him to think she cared,
was no longer a matter for debate. She assured herself
that there was nothing base in the relationship
into which she had entered with him; that the attraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
had been of the mind and spirit first of all. She
swiftly reviewed all the points upon which her justification
rested, and was satisfied that they stood the
test of the morning sunlight and the clean wholesome
air. She had no regrets; no misgivings. She had
already convinced herself that their love was sufficient
in itself. He turned from time to time to smile at
her and took her hand that it might rest beneath his
on the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t settled yet when I&#8217;m to see you again.
I want every minute you can give. Can&#8217;t we have
dinner together tonight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could, but I&#8217;ve got to go home for
supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can see you afterwards,&mdash;please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could go to Miss Lawton&#8217;s where we met the first
time. I think I can fix it with Minnie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s settled! I understand perfectly that
you have your family to consider and we&#8217;ve got to
remember there are people in the world who haven&#8217;t
much to do but pry into other people&#8217;s business.
They&#8217;re a large and mischievous phalanx. For the
present we&#8217;ve got to be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was rather relieved that he did not amplify
the suggestive &#8220;for the present.&#8221; He was thinking,
she assumed, of his wife and the freedom which he
had intimated would be his for the asking. But marriage
was no assurance of the perpetuation of love;
it was a convention, no doubt desirable and necessary
for society&#8217;s protection; but Grace was in a mood to
enjoy her sense of being in rebellion against society,
that intangible &#8220;they&#8221; which, she had brought herself
to believe, quite ignorantly established laws and
in the light of them appraised and condemned human
frailty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>She derived the greatest comfort from this idea; it
encouraged and strengthened her belief that she was
an independent unit of the social order. If her relationship
with Trenton became known she would forfeit
the love and confidence of her family and many prized
friendships. But his love would be compensation for
anything she might lose in the eyes of people she felt
to be hopelessly shackled to old notions of rectitude
and chastity with which she no longer felt any concern.
It would be necessary, of course, to maintain
secrecy; but it was no one&#8217;s business what she did with
her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last chance for a kiss,&#8221; Trenton exclaimed, slipping
his arm about her as they reached the Meridian
street bridge.</p>

<p>She asked him to let her out at the soldiers&#8217; monument
to avoid the possibility of being inspected by
questioning eyes at Shipley&#8217;s. Trenton was going at
once to Kemp&#8217;s house to make sure Tommy was all
right; he meant to have it out with Tommy about his
drinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell your father I&#8217;d like to see him tomorrow at
two o&#8217;clock. Yes; I have the address.&#8221;</p>

<p>With his good-bye ringing in her ears she walked
the few remaining blocks to the store.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Grace reached home that evening her absence
of the preceding night was barely mentioned by her
mother, and Ethel did not refer to it at all. The
conduct of another member of the family had aroused
grave apprehensions in the domestic circle and any
suspected derelictions of her own were suffered to
pass, or were accepted in a spirit of resignation, as a
part of a visitation of an inscrutable providence upon
the house of Durland.</p>

<p>Roy had turned up in the early hours of the morning
much the worse for dalliance with a contraband
beverage that had served him ill. There was gloom
in the kitchen where she found her mother and Ethel
preparing supper and after satisfying herself that she
was not the cause of the depression she summoned
courage to ask her mother what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, mother,&#8221; said Ethel loftily, &#8220;that Grace
should <i>know</i>. It may be possible that she can help
us in our trouble. Roy has always been fonder of her
than of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel&#8217;s tone was replete with intimations that this
affection was not wholly complimentary to either her
brother or sister. She entered upon a circumstantial
account of Roy&#8217;s misbehavior which omitted nothing
that could enhance its heinousness, Mrs. Durland interrupting
occasionally to soften the harsh terms in
which Ethel described Roy&#8217;s appearance on the snowy
threshold at two o&#8217;clock, in the care of two young
friends in little better condition than himself. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
been necessary to summon a doctor to relieve Roy&#8217;s
stomach of the poison he had consumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the first and last time for Roy,&#8221; said
Mrs. Durland. &#8220;He&#8217;s terribly cut up over it; but of
course at the holiday season, and meeting old friends
and all, I suppose we must make allowances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to look at it, mother,&#8221; said Grace,
sincerely grieved for her mother and anxious to restore
her confidence in Roy. &#8220;I know Roy wouldn&#8217;t do
anything to trouble you. We ought to be glad that
stuff didn&#8217;t kill him! Roy isn&#8217;t the only boy who
thinks it smart to drink now that it&#8217;s forbidden. I
hear a lot about that, down town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you do,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland, catching
hopefully at the suggestion that her boy was not the
only wanderer in the path that leads to destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy knows our hopes are centered in him; there&#8217;s
not the slightest excuse for his conduct!&#8221; Ethel resumed,
unwilling that Roy&#8217;s sin should be covered up
in charitable generalizations. &#8220;Instead of running
around with a lot of dissolute young men he ought to
be making friends who can help him get a start in
life. As for prohibition, it&#8217;s the law of the land and
you&#8217;d think a young man who&#8217;s studying law would
respect it. Only the other day Osgood gave me an
article with statistics showing what&#8217;s being done to
enforce the law and it will only be a short time until
the rum power is completely vanquished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dying mighty hard,&#8221; remarked Grace cheerfully.
&#8220;Anybody can get whiskey who has the price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One would think&mdash;&#8221; began Ethel, moved at once
to give battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not hankering for it myself,&#8221; Grace interrupted.
&#8220;But they ought to enforce the law or
repeal it. I&#8217;m only saying what everybody knows.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;Well, of course, Grace, we don&#8217;t know just <i>who</i>
your friends are,&#8221; Ethel retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they probably wouldn&#8217;t amuse you even if you
knew them!&#8221; Grace flung back.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mrs. Durland, who was arranging a
tray with coffee and toast to carry up to Roy, announced
that enough had been said on the subject.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Trenton&#8217;s week in town lengthened to ten days.
Minnie Lawton&#8217;s apartment proved to be a convenient
meeting place, and on two evenings Grace and Trenton
dined there alone, with Jerry to serve them. Trenton
had persuaded Kemp to go to a hospital for rest and
observation. The reports of the local physician merely
confirmed what the New York specialist had told
Trenton as to his friend&#8217;s condition. Trenton took
Irene and Grace to the hospital to see Kemp one
evening. They found him looking a little thin and
white but he greeted them joyfully. He wasn&#8217;t wholly
cut off from civilization in spite of their efforts to get
rid of him, he said, pointing gleefully to a telephone
at his bedside which he had obtained as a special
concession. He boasted that he could lie in bed and
direct his business affairs almost as well as at his
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the nurses won&#8217;t flirt with me,&#8221; he complained,
&#8220;and you girls showed up just in time to keep me from
passing up your whole unaccountable sex. I&#8217;ve got to
be amused even if I am locked up here with fourteen
disagreeable things being done to me every day. The
purpose of woman is to amuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go, Tommy! Women are divided into
two classes,&#8221; said Irene in her spacious manner, &#8220;those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
who amuse their husbands and those who amuse other
women&#8217;s husbands. It&#8217;s not for me to say to which
variety, subdivision or group I prefer to belong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenton had visited Stephen Durland twice at his
shop in the Power Building and at the hospital he
mentioned the matter of Durland&#8217;s improvements on
the Cummings-Durland motor. The issuance of the
patents to Durland had brought inquiries from several
Eastern manufacturers and the representative of one
concern had opened negotiations for an option.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Grace,&#8221; said Kemp when Trenton had
explained concisely the nature of the improvements,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be mighty sore if you let this escape
before I have a look at it. Go on, Ward, and tell me
more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You father must have something good,&#8221; said Irene,
who had listened attentively to the talk, &#8220;for I don&#8217;t
understand a word of it. I hope there&#8217;s millions in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That new composition Mr. Durland&#8217;s working on
for non-cracking spark-plug porcelains will be worth
something handsome if it&#8217;s as good as it promises to
be,&#8221; Trenton remarked. Kemp&#8217;s alert curiosity had
to be satisfied as to the nature of the substance Durland
was working on and Trenton went into the chemistry
of the composition and said it would have to be
subjected to more exacting tests.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll test that at my plant too,&#8221; said Kemp, &#8220;but
the sooner we get to work on the motor the better.
We&#8217;ll give Mr. Durland a corner in my shop, and all
the help he needs; I&#8217;ll call up the superintendent in
the morning and explain what&#8217;s wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all too good to be true!&#8221; said Grace.
&#8220;Father&#8217;s such a dear, patient, gentle soul and to land
something now will mean more than you can understand.
Thank you so much, Tommy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>She walked to the bed and took Kemp&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose your father would rather Cummings had
the new features for the engine,&#8221; he said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious heavens, no!&#8221; Grace exclaimed. &#8220;Father
would cheerfully die in the poor house before he&#8217;d
let Cummings have anything of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit! Ward, don&#8217;t be stingy with Mr.
Durland. Double whatever anybody else offers for
an option on the motor improvements and we&#8217;ll hope
it&#8217;s only the beginning.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Stephen Durland discussed with Grace everything
pertaining to his new connection with the Kemp concern.
He had made so many mistakes in his life that
he didn&#8217;t want to risk making any more, he said
pathetically at a noon hour which Grace spent with
him after he had agreed to the terms Kemp had proposed
through Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand dollars just for an option looks mighty
big,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I never expected to see that much
money again. And I&#8217;m to draw two hundred a month
from the Kemp Company while I&#8217;m building a motor
out there. It&#8217;s pretty nice, Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wanted to give her the thousand dollars and
any income he might derive from the improved motor
as compensation for what he felt was the wrong she
had suffered through his inability to keep her in college.
He was greatly in earnest about this and showed
his affection for her in a shy gentle fashion that
touched her deeply. She laughed him into accepting
her rejection of his offer and overruled his decision
not to tell his wife and Ethel of his brightening prospects.
The motor might not stand up under the tests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
he said, and he wished to avoid the necessity of confessing
a fresh failure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid; I&#8217;ll see that you don&#8217;t get scolded!
You just strut around the house and make the most of
your success&mdash;for that&#8217;s what it is! Mr. Trenton
told me he was sure your improvements were enormously
important&mdash;greater efficiency, greater economy
of operation and every other little old thing you&#8217;ve
thought up in that dear bean of yours!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trenton&#8217;s a fine man. He&#8217;s been mighty nice to
me,&#8221; said Durland. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure to talk to a man
who catches an idea so quick. I guess Kemp does
pretty much what he says. I don&#8217;t know Kemp. I
never thought of it till after the break, but Cummings
never wanted me to meet other manufacturers in our
line. Guess he didn&#8217;t trust me,&#8221; he ended with a
grim smile. &#8220;Afraid I might get away from him before
he was sure I&#8217;d petered out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He guessed wrong, daddy! We&#8217;ll let Cummings
do the worrying now.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the day he closed his shop in the Power Building
and moved to the experimental room that had been
fitted up for him at Kemp&#8217;s big plant Durland mentioned
his new prospects at the supper table. He made
the disclosure so slightingly that Mrs. Durland and
Ethel, who had been busily discussing the merits of a
novel they had been reading and Ethel thought grossly
immoral, failed to catch the point of the revelation until
he had cleared his throat and announced for a
second time that he was moving out to Kemp&#8217;s to do a
little experimenting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s yours, Allie,&#8221; he remarked, producing
the check. &#8220;Got it for an option on a patent I&#8217;ve
been tinkering at. Trenton, that Pittsburgh expert,
recommended it to Kemp.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>&#8220;Trenton?&#8221; repeated Ethel, carefully scrutinizing
the Kemp Manufacturing Company&#8217;s check before
passing it on to her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Ward Trenton,&#8221; Durland replied with a note
of pride that so distinguished an engineer had recognized
his merits. &#8220;He keeps track of everything that
goes through the patent office for clients he&#8217;s got all
over the country. I&#8217;m going to build some of my
motors at Kemp&#8217;s; they&#8217;ve given me a lot better place
to work in than I used to have at Cummings&#8217;s, and I&#8217;m
going to have all the help I want. And I&#8217;m to draw
two hundred a month while I&#8217;m there. I guess that&#8217;s
fair enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your friend, Trenton, is it, Grace?&#8221; asked
Ethel, awed into respect by the size of the check.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; Grace replied, carelessly meeting
Ethel&#8217;s gaze across the table. &#8220;He&#8217;s the kindest man
imaginable. You can hardly complain of his treatment
of father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve <i>always</i> believed in father,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;I
hope Isaac Cummings will see in this a retribution&mdash;God&#8217;s
punishment for the way he treated father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not hand out the retribution to Cummings
till Kemp&#8217;s satisfied about the motor,&#8221; suggested
Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all proud of you, Stephen,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland,
smoothing the creases in the check. &#8220;I&#8217;m writing
Roy tonight and I&#8217;ll tell him the good news. Of
course I&#8217;ll warn him not to speak of it. Your success
will be a great incentive to the dear boy. He was so
contrite over his behavior while he was home that
I&#8217;m glad to have this news for him. We should all
feel grateful. Something told me when Isaac Cummings
turned you out that it was for the best. I&#8217;ll
never again question the ways of Providence. I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
feel like taking this money, Stephen, but it will come
in handy in giving Roy a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the happier spirit that now dominated the home
circle Grace&#8217;s increasingly frequent absences for
evenings and occasionally for a night passed with little
or no remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to live your life in your own way,&#8221;
Mrs. Durland would say with a sigh when she found
Grace leaving the house after supper. &#8220;I hardly see
you any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>To guard against awakening in Ethel&#8217;s mind any
suspicion that her evenings away from home coincided
with Trenton&#8217;s presence in town, which her father
usually mentioned, Grace made a point of going out
at times when Trenton was away. There were always
things she could do&mdash;entertainments among the
Shipley employees, dances, theatre parties of business
girls with whom she had become acquainted.
These engagements she refrained from describing with
any particularity as this would make the more marked
her silence on evenings when she went to Minnie Lawton&#8217;s
to meet Trenton. She had adopted a regular
formula when she left the house, saying merely, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going out for a little while,&#8221; which her mother and
Ethel had schooled themselves to accept as an
adequate explanation of her absences.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bob Cummings looked in on her one day at
Shipley&#8217;s with the promised invitation to dinner, and
to go to a club dance afterwards, which Grace refused
only because the dramatic club of Shipley employees
was giving a play the same night and she had a leading
part. And Miss Reynolds dropped in to the ready-to-wear
department frequently when she was down
town and occasionally asked Grace to dinner.</p>

<p>The mild winter almost imperceptibly gave way before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
the blithe heralds of spring and April appeared
smiling at the threshold.</p>

<p>No cloud darkened the even course of her affair
with Trenton. She was more and more convinced
of the depth and sincerity of her love for him and he
was the tenderest, the most considerate of lovers.
When she did not see him, sometimes for a week or
fortnight, his messages floated back with those constant
reassurances of his loyalty and affection that
are the very food of love. He rarely mentioned his
wife in their talks and Grace was no longer a prey to
jealousy. She wondered sometimes whether he had
ever broached to Mrs. Trenton the matter of the
divorce at which he had hinted, but Grace found herself
caring little about this one way or another. She
exulted in her independence, complacent in the thought
that she was a woman of the Twentieth Century, free
to use her life as she would.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>John Moore had not crossed Grace&#8217;s vision since the
afternoon of Christmas day, when his unexpected appearance
in the highway near The Shack proved so
disconcerting. She suspected that he was avoiding her,
probably from a generous wish to spare her the embarrassment
of explaining herself.</p>

<p>When she left Shipley&#8217;s at the closing hour of a day
early in April she was surprised to see him waiting at
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, Grace! Hope you don&#8217;t mind being
held up, but I wanted to see you and this seemed the
easiest way. Got time to walk home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace had meant to take the car but she decided
instantly that in view of the glimpse he had got of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
her in Trenton&#8217;s arms on the memorable day at The
Shack it would be poor diplomacy to refuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll walk, John,&#8221; she replied cordially.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting to see you.&#8221; She waited till they
were out of the crowd, then said with a preluding
laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be thinking the awfulest things of me,
and that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve given me the go-by. That
was an awful fib I told you Christmas about going to
a matinee. The truth of the matter was that I had
promised to go with some people into the country for
the afternoon and didn&#8217;t want the family to know;
and I couldn&#8217;t explain over the telephone. And out
there we all got to cutting up and well&mdash;you saw me!
I&#8217;m terribly ashamed of myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, you needn&#8217;t be! I didn&#8217;t think anything
about it. I always know you&#8217;re all right. I&#8217;m
for you, Grace&mdash;you know that. I&#8217;ve been so busy
since I moved to town that I&#8217;ve kept my nose right
on the grindstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words lacked the usual John Moore flavor, and
in spite of his protest she guiltily attributed his unusual
restraint to reservations as to the Christmas
day episode. But his next speech quickly shifted the
ground of her apprehensions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been down to Bloomington to see Roy,&#8221;
he said, doggedly blurting out the sentences. &#8220;The boy
sent for me; he&#8217;d got into a bad scrape&mdash;about a girl.
You can guess the rest of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she gasped, feeling the earth whirling. &#8220;Not
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy was in a blue funk and threatened to run
away but I talked him out of that. The girl&#8217;s name is
Sadie Denton; she&#8217;s not really a bad girl. I had a
talk with her and went down to Louisville with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
yesterday and saw them married. Her folks live there
and they&#8217;ll look out for her till Roy finishes at the
law school. I guess that&#8217;s about all. He didn&#8217;t want
any of you to know about it just yet; but I sat down on
that and he agreed I should tell you. I was sure you&#8217;d
handle it right at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it will break mother&#8217;s heart! She&#8217;s counted
everything on Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, everything isn&#8217;t lost yet,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I
hope you think I did right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the only thing, of course, John. It was just
like you to see it straight and do the right thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wormed from him the fact that he had given
Roy a hundred dollars, and that certain payments for
the support of Roy&#8217;s wife had been agreed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certainly a friend, John. We&#8217;ll return the
money at once; that&#8217;s the least we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he protested that he did not need the money
immediately she explained that her father&#8217;s affairs
were looking brighter and that the return of the sum
advanced would work no hardship.</p>

<p>The bad news having been delivered, Moore exerted
himself to cheer her, but a vast gloom had settled upon
her. As he shook hands at the gate her sense of his
tolerance, kindness and wisdom brought tears to her
eyes but, left alone, her only emotion was one of fury
against Roy. She stood on the doorstep pondering.
Again, as after Roy&#8217;s appeal for money to cover his
share of the expense of his automobile escapade, she
thought of her own weakness in yielding to temptation.
But for John&#8217;s advice that it would be better for the
rest of the family to know at once of Roy&#8217;s tragedy&mdash;this
being the only word that fitly described this new
and discouraging blight upon her brother&#8217;s future&mdash;she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
would have lacked the courage to communicate
the evil tidings to the household.</p>

<p>It was not until they had all settled in the living
room after supper that she broke the news. Her
father sat at the table, reading a technical journal,
with Ethel near by preparing her Sunday-school lesson.
Mrs. Durland had established herself by the
grate with the family darning in her lap. Since Durland&#8217;s
removal to Kemp&#8217;s establishment a new cheer
and hope had lightened the atmosphere of the home,
and Grace, moving restlessly about the room, dreaded
to launch her thunderbolt upon the tranquil scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to tell you; please listen,&mdash;you
too, father,&#8221; she began quietly.</p>

<p>She used much the same blunt phrases in which
Moore had condensed the story, watching with a kind
of fascination a long black stocking slip from her
mother&#8217;s hand, pause at her knee and then crawl in
a slow serpentine fashion down her apron to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Roy!&#8221; Mrs. Durland moaned, her face white.</p>

<p>Mr. Durland coughed, took off his glasses, breathed
on the lenses and began slowly rubbing them with
the corner of the linen table cover. He desisted suddenly,
remembering that Ethel had once rebuked him
for mussing the cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s all there is to say about it,&#8221; Grace
concluded when she had told everything, not omitting
their financial obligation to Moore. &#8220;We&#8217;ve all got
to make the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace picked up the fallen stocking and handed it
to her mother, who made a pretense of carefully inspecting
a hole in the heel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time&#8217;s the first train down in the morning?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;I must see Roy&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>Ethel, who had sunk back helplessly in her chair,
jumped to her feet, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t go one step mother! It&#8217;s enough that
Roy&#8217;s brought this disgrace on the family without
you going down there to pet him. It&#8217;s your spoiling
him that&#8217;s made him what he is. John Moore had
no business meddling in our affairs. What Roy should
have done was to go away and never show his face
to any of us again. Father, you tell mother to keep
away from Roy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The appeal to Durland, who had so rarely found
himself a court of last resort in the whole course of his
life, was not without its humor and Grace smiled bitterly
as she watched her sister, who stood before her,
white, her lips set in hard lines, her hands clenched
at her sides. Durland cleared his throat and recrossed
his legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess your mother&#8217;ll do the right thing, Ethel,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re all crazy!&#8221; Ethel flared. &#8220;What will
Osgood think of me, with my brother forced to marry a
girl off the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say she was off the street,&#8221; Grace corrected
her. &#8220;I&#8217;d show the girl a little mercy if I were you,
and I wouldn&#8217;t make it any harder than necessary for
father and mother. You&#8217;re not the only one of us
who has feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave! The rest of you may do as you please,
but I&#8217;ll not let Osgood think I don&#8217;t feel the <i>shame</i>
of my brother&#8217;s sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Osgood reads his Testament he may not see it
in quite that light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel breathed hard in the effort to think of some
withering retort. The best she could do, however,
was not especially brilliant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;Osgood,&#8221; she announced grandly, &#8220;is a gentleman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might be that and still be a Christian,&#8221; Grace
replied tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say about trains, Grace,&#8221; asked Mrs.
Durland, who, deep in thought, had scarcely heard
the colloquy between her daughters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call the station and find out. And I&#8217;ll get
Irene on the &#8217;phone and tell her I won&#8217;t be at the
store tomorrow. I&#8217;m going with you, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel caught up and flung back the name as though
it were some hateful and obscene thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethel,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland serenely, &#8220;If you&#8217;ve got
nothing better to do you might help me with the darning.
I don&#8217;t like to go away without clearing it up.&#8221;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The visit to Bloomington was not particularly heartening.
Roy was in a sullen humor when they talked
to him in the hotel parlor. He wanted to drop the law
course and go West, and they argued the matter most
of the day, Grace alternating between despair at Roy&#8217;s
stubborn indifference to every attempt to arouse his
pride and ambition and admiration for her mother&#8217;s
courage and forbearance in the most poignant sorrow
of her life.</p>

<p>Grace finally left them together and took a walk that
led her far from the campus. She had no heart for
looking upon the familiar scenes or meeting the
friends she had left there only a few months earlier.
When she returned to the hotel Roy had been won to
a more tractable humor; and when he left them it
was in a spirit of submission, at least, to what he considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
an ungenerous ordering of fate. Mrs. Durland
insisted on carrying out the plan, with which she had
left Indianapolis, of visiting the young woman who
was now her daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s Roy&#8217;s wife,&#8221; she said when Grace tried to
dissuade her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll feel better to see her. And it&#8217;s
only right I should.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the train for Louisville and Grace went
home.</p>

<p>Grace&#8217;s thoughts were given a new direction early
the next morning when Miss Beulah Reynolds appeared
at Shipley&#8217;s shortly after the doors were
opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, the most astounding thing has happened!&#8221;
the little woman declared immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your house hasn&#8217;t burned down!&#8221; exclaimed
Grace, amused by the little woman&#8217;s agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse! I&#8217;m to have a visitor,&mdash;that Mary Graham
Trenton whose book we once talked about. I&#8217;ve
just had a letter from an old friend in Boston warning
me of the lady&#8217;s approach, and asking me to see the
Indians don&#8217;t get her. I&#8217;ve wired her at Cleveland
asking her to stay at my house&mdash;I could hardly do
less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; said Grace faintly, wondering why
Miss Reynolds had come to her with the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m asking some people to dinner the night the
lady lectures&mdash;Tuesday&mdash;and I want you to come.
Don&#8217;t look so scared! She may not be as terrible as
she writes but I&#8217;m going to invite Dr. Ridgely, and
my doctor and my lawyer with the hope that they&#8217;ll all
get a shock. And I want you to come; you&#8217;ve read
her stuff, and I&#8217;ll count on you to help keep the talk
going.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&#8221; Grace began, her mind in
a whirl of conjecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! That&#8217;s a dear child. Don&#8217;t go back on me;
I need your moral support. At six thirty, then? We
have to dine early on account of the lecture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes; Miss Reynolds,&#8221; Grace answered
faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the little pink ear of Venus!&#8221; exclaimed Irene,
coming upon Grace just as Miss Reynolds left. &#8220;What&#8217;s
Little Old Ready-Money done to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Grace replied, her mind still in confusion.
&#8220;She was just asking me to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From your looks I&#8217;d have guessed it was a funeral,&#8221;
Irene replied, and Grace, pulling herself together, hurried
away to meet an approaching customer.</p>

<p>Of late she had given little thought to Mrs. Trenton,
and it had never occurred to her in her wildest dreams
that she might meet Ward&#8217;s wife in the intimate contact
of a dinner table. The prospect kept her in a
state of excitement all day and at times she was
strongly impelled to trump up some excuse for refusing
to go to Miss Reynolds&#8217;s. But her earlier curiosity
as to what manner of woman it was who bore
Ward Trenton&#8217;s name was rekindled by the thought
of meeting her. Trenton was in Syracuse and might
not reach Indianapolis for a week or more. He had
said that he had not, in the letter he had written
to Mrs. Trenton from St. Louis, revealed the identity
of the woman who had so strongly appealed to him.
Mrs. Trenton would hardly suspect that a girl she
met at a dinner party was the person her husband
had described only vaguely and without indicating
her habitat.</p>

<p>Grace decided against writing Trenton of the impending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
meeting till it was over. Having quieted her
apprehensions she began dramatizing the scene at
Miss Reynolds&#8217;s table and she reread &#8220;Clues to a
New Social Order&#8221; against the possibility that Mrs.
Trenton&#8217;s book might become a subject of discussion
at the dinner. The thought of seeing her lover&#8217;s
wife in this fashion while she herself remained unknown
and unsuspected laid powerful hold upon her
imagination.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> calamity that had befallen Roy cast a shadow
upon the Durland household. Ethel stalked about
with an insufferable air of outraged innocence. Roy
had ruined the family; after all the sacrifices that
had been made for him he had flung away his chance
and was lost beyond redemption. She was merciless
in her denunciation of her brother, and hardly less
severe upon her mother for spoiling Roy and condoning
his sin.</p>

<p>Grace exerted herself to the utmost to dispel the
gloom. Not since her young girlhood had she felt
so closely drawn to her mother, and she endeavored
by every possible means to lighten her burdens. Mrs.
Durland&#8217;s attempts to make the best of Roy&#8217;s predicament,
even professing to see in what she called the
boy&#8217;s new responsibilities a steadying force that would
evoke his best efforts, were pathetic; but Grace encouraged
all these hopes though in her heart she was
far from optimistic as to her brother&#8217;s future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sadie isn&#8217;t really a bad girl,&#8221; Mrs. Durland had reported
on her return from Louisville. &#8220;Her family
are not just what we would have wanted, but they
are respectable and we ought to be grateful for that.
Her father is employed in the railroad shops and
they own their own home. Sadie&#8217;s an only child and
it wasn&#8217;t necessary for her to go to work, but she was
restless and didn&#8217;t want to stay at home. There&#8217;s
a lot of that spirit among girls these days. Sadie&#8217;s
really fond of Roy and I think she understands that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
now she must help him to make a man of himself.
She and her mother appreciated our kindness and I
think, Ethel, when you see Sadie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I see Sadie!&#8221; cried Ethel, choking at the
name. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you&#8217;re going to bring
her to this house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, of course; she wouldn&#8217;t want to come.
But in time we&#8217;ll all know her. You must remember
Ethel that she&#8217;s one of the family, your brother&#8217;s
wife, and no matter how much we may regret the
whole thing, we&#8217;ve got to stand by her just as we
stand by Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, mother; I don&#8217;t understand
you at all! It isn&#8217;t like you to pass over a thing
like this, that&#8217;s brought shame and disgrace on the
family. And to think&mdash;to <i>think</i>&mdash;&#8221; she cried hysterically&mdash;&#8220;that
you even consider bringing the
shameless creature here to this house, with all its
sacred associations that mean something to me if they
don&#8217;t to the rest of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Ethel,&#8221; said Grace ironically. &#8220;It&#8217;s
perfectly grand of you to defend the family altar!
I suppose when Sadie comes you&#8217;ll be for throwing
her into the street and stoning her to death. And
you&#8217;d be the only one who could cast the first stone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please be quiet, girls,&#8221; Mrs. Durland pleaded. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t help any to fuss about things. You haven&#8217;t
taken this as I hoped you would, Ethel. If we don&#8217;t
stand together and help each other the family tie
doesn&#8217;t amount to much. I had hoped you were going
to feel better about Roy. We simply mustn&#8217;t let the
dear boy think that just one misstep has ruined his
life. We must try to believe that everything is for
the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, mother,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;That&#8217;s the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
way to look at it. Ethel doesn&#8217;t mean to trouble you.
She&#8217;ll come round all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel failed to confirm this sanguine prediction.
She continued to sulk and when her mother proposed
plans for assisting Roy when he finished at the law
school she contributed to the discussion only the direst
predictions of disaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all have a lot to be thankful for,&#8221; Mrs. Durland
insisted. &#8220;It&#8217;s a blessing your father&#8217;s going to
be in a position to help Roy. The first year will be
the hardest for the boy, but after that he ought to be
able to stand on his own feet. I&#8217;ve about decided that
it would be better for him to open an office for himself
right away and not go in with any one else. The
more independent he feels the better. We must see
what we can do about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better talk it all over with John Moore
before we decide about anything,&#8221; Grace suggested.
&#8220;He knows all about Roy and certainly has shown
himself a good friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John Moore!&#8221; sniffed Ethel, who had not forgiven
John for meddling in Roy&#8217;s affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you love yourself, Ethel; you certainly
don&#8217;t love anybody else.&#8221; Grace remarked, and
added, &#8220;Oh, yes, there&#8217;s Osgood! I forgot that you&#8217;re
concentrating your affections on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to see him at home; that&#8217;s more
than you do with the men you run around with!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t dare introduce my friends to you;
you might vamp them away from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now girls&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland sighed heavily; Mr. Durland, intent
upon some computations he was making at the living
room table, stirred uneasily. Grace had not been unmindful
of the fact that after his first fortnight at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
Kemp&#8217;s the elation with which he had undertaken his
new labors had passed. He was now constructing an
engine embodying his improvements on the Cummings-Durland
motor and came home at night haggard
and preoccupied. He seemed to resent inquiries as
to his progress and after the first week Mrs. Durland,
on a hint from Grace, ceased troubling him with questions.
Grace herself was wondering whether, after
all, the ideas that had attracted Trenton&#8217;s attention
in her father&#8217;s patent claims might not fail to realize
what was hoped of them. But her faith in Trenton&#8217;s
judgment was boundless; with his long experience it
was hardly possible that he could be deceived or that
he would encourage expectations that might not be
realized by the most exacting tests.</p>

<p>Grace had not changed her mind about going to
Miss Reynolds&#8217;s dinner, though at times she had all
but reconsidered her decision not to tell Trenton of
the invitation. There was really no reason why she
should not let him know of his wife&#8217;s impending visit
to Indianapolis; what really stayed her hand when
she considered mentioning the matter in one of her
letters was a fear that he might advise her against
going. Her curiosity as to Ward Trenton&#8217;s wife was
acute and outweighed any fear of his possible displeasure
when he learned&mdash;and of course Grace
meant to tell him&mdash;that she had deliberately put herself
in Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s way.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>On Saturday evening the delivery of a gown she had
picked out of Shipley&#8217;s stock to wear to the dinner
made it necessary to explain why she had purchased
it. It was the simplest of dinner gowns which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
drew from the box and held up for her mother&#8217;s and
Ethel&#8217;s inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;What earthly use can you have for that, Grace?&#8221;
Ethel demanded.</p>

<p>Grace laid it across her mother&#8217;s knees and Mrs.
Durland took a fold in her fingers to appraise the
material.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly pretty. This is one of the new shades,
isn&#8217;t it, Grace? It isn&#8217;t blue exactly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They call it hydrangea blue, mother. Please
hurry and say I&#8217;ll look scrumptious in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have chosen just <i>that</i>,&#8221; remarked
Ethel putting down a handkerchief she was embroidering,
in flourishing script with the initials O. H., to
eye the garment critically. &#8220;If I were in your place
and could afford to spend what that must have cost I
think I&#8217;d have got something in one of the more
definite shades. You can&#8217;t really say whether that&#8217;s
blue or pink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the artistic part of it, old dear,&#8221; replied
Grace amiably. &#8220;It&#8217;s out of the new spring stock and
considered very smart. Wake up, daddy! Tell me
you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m stung!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess my views about dresses wouldn&#8217;t help you
much, Grace,&#8221; Durland remarked, glancing at the
gown absently and returning to his interminable calculations.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll look sweet in it, Grace,&#8221; Mrs. Durland volunteered.
&#8220;You think it isn&#8217;t cut too low?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the very latest model, mother. I don&#8217;t believe
you&#8217;ll think it too low when you see me in it. I tried
it on at my lunch hour yesterday and a customer got
her eye on it and did her best to coax me to let her
have it. But I sold her another gown that cost twenty
dollars more, so Shipley&#8217;s didn&#8217;t lose anything.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;You get so many clothes, Grace,&#8221; Ethel interrupted
again intent upon her embroidery. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
just see what you can want with a dress like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is for a special occasion. Miss Reynolds
has asked me to dinner Tuesday. She&#8217;s entertaining
for Mrs. Mary Graham Trenton, who&#8217;s to lecture here
that night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Durland. &#8220;I
read in the paper that Mrs. Trenton was to speak
here. I&#8217;d never have thought of connecting her with
Miss Reynolds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve never met, I think. A friend of Miss
Reynolds&#8217;s in Boston wrote and asked her to see that
Mrs. Trenton was properly looked after, so she&#8217;s putting
her up and pulling off a dinner in her honor. I
might say that she didn&#8217;t appear to be awfully keen
about it. She&#8217;s asking Dr. Ridgely and Judge Sanders
and Dr. Loomis with their ladies, so theology, law
and medicine will be represented. She asked me, I
suppose, because I happened to mention to her once
that I had read Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s &#8216;Clues to a New Social
Order.&#8217; And it may be in her mind that as a poor
working girl I represent the proletariat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may have thought that being a friend of Mr.
Trenton&#8217;s it would be pleasant for Mrs. Trenton to
meet you,&#8221; said Ethel sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sister, you&#8217;re certainly the little mind
reader,&#8221; Grace replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s very kind of Miss Reynolds to ask
you,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Durland hastily, fearing a clash
between the sisters. &#8220;There are no finer people in
town than the Sanders and I have always heard splendid
things about Dr. Loomis and his wife. It&#8217;s a
privilege to meet people like that. I hope you realize
that a woman of Miss Reynolds&#8217;s position can have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
her pick of the town. She&#8217;s certainly paying you a
great compliment, Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand Miss Reynolds at all,&#8221; said
Ethel. &#8220;She&#8217;s the last woman in the world you&#8217;d
think would take a creature like Mary Graham Trenton
into her house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because she is Miss Reynolds that she can do
as she pleases,&#8221; replied Mrs. Durland conciliatingly.
&#8220;And as she was asked by a friend to show some
courtesy to Mrs. Trenton, she isn&#8217;t doing any more
than any one else would do in the same circumstances.
As I said when Grace first spoke of meeting Mr. Trenton,
his wife&#8217;s a dangerous woman. It&#8217;s in her power
to do a great deal of mischief in the world. I don&#8217;t
believe Miss Reynolds has any patience with Mrs.
Trenton&#8217;s ideas, and it can&#8217;t do Grace any harm to
meet her. You ought to be glad, Ethel, that Miss
Reynolds feels that Grace would fit into a select party
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be surprised if Dr. Ridgely goes to the dinner,&#8221;
replied Ethel. &#8220;That woman is fighting everything
the church stands for. If I had my way she
wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to speak here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no joke!&#8221; replied Grace good-naturedly.
&#8220;But there are people, you know, who are not afraid
of hearing radical ideas&mdash;a few broad-minded people
who think it safer to let the cranks talk out in the
open than to drive them into a cellar to touch off the
gentle bomb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many people feel just that way, Ethel,&#8221; said Mrs.
Durland.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland&#8217;s disapproval of Mrs. Trenton and
the ideas identified with that lady&#8217;s name was much
softened by the fact that Grace was to be included in
a formal dinner which Miss Reynolds had undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
arranged with care. And while Mary Graham Trenton
might entertain and preach the most shocking
ideas she was nevertheless one of the best known
and most discussed women in America, besides being
the inheritor of wealth and social position. Miss Reynolds&#8217;s
marked liking for Grace afforded Mrs. Durland
a satisfaction not wholly attributable to veneration for
Miss Reynolds&#8217;s money or unassailable position as a
member of a pioneer Indianapolis family. Grace&#8217;s
unaccountable ways and her assertions of independence
often brought alarm and dismay to the
mother&#8217;s heart; but Grace was indubitably lovely to
look at and the fine spirit in which she had accepted
and met the curtailment of her course at the university
excused many things. Grace had wits and she
would go far, but the traveling would have to be on
broad highways of her own choosing. It was not without
twinges of heartache that Mrs. Durland realized
that this dark-eyed daughter was peculiarly a child of
the new order; that not by prayer, threat or cajolery
could she be made to walk in old paths or heed the old
admonitions. But there had been Morleys who
were independent and forthright and Miss Reynolds&#8217;s
invitation implied a recognition of Grace as a well-bred
and intelligent girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durland, busily sewing, had been giving Grace
such information as she possessed about the Sanderses,
who were to be of Miss Reynolds&#8217;s company. Hardly
less than the sons and daughters of Virginia and Kentucky,
Mrs. Durland was possessed of a vast amount
of lore touching the families of her native state. Mrs.
Sanders was a Shelton of the old Bartholomew County
family of that name. Some Shelton had once been
engaged in business with a Morley who was a second
cousin of Mrs. Durland. It was a tannery she thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
though it might have been a brickyard. And Sanders&#8217;s
father had been a prominent citizen somewhere
on the lower Wabash and had married into the Alston
family of Vanderburgh County. Grace lent a sympathetic
ear to this recital of ancient Hoosier history
chiefly because her mother found so great a pleasure
in reciting it. It was the cruelest of ironies that her
mother, with all her adoration of the State and its
traditions and her constant recurrence to the past
glories of the Morleys, lived a life of self-denial apart
from contemporaries capable of sharing her pride and
pleasure in the old times.</p>

<p>The talk had wandered far from Grace&#8217;s dinner
engagement when Ethel, who had been quietly plying
her needle, took advantage of a lull to switch it back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you won&#8217;t feel <i>quite</i> like a stranger with
Mrs. Trenton,&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;Mr. Trenton has no
doubt told his wife of his acquaintance with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt he has,&#8221; Grace replied calmly. &#8220;In fact
he told me he had written her about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not wholly candid; Trenton had only said
that he had written to his wife, pursuant to an understanding
between them, that he had met a girl
who greatly interested him. But Ethel&#8217;s remark occasioned
Grace a moment of discomfort. In her last
meeting with Trenton his wife had not been mentioned,
but it was possible that by now he had made
a complete confession of his unfaithfulness. Irene
Kirby had frequently commented upon Trenton&#8217;s
frankness; Grace chilled at the thought that he might
already have told his story to Mrs. Trenton in the hope
of hastening the day of his freedom.</p>

<p>The newspapers were devoting much space to Mrs.
Trenton&#8217;s impending visit. On Saturday and Sunday
her portrait adorned the society pages, accompanied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
sketches of her life and activities in the feminist cause
that did full justice to her distinguished ancestry and
high social connections. In the Durland home Mrs.
Trenton continued to be a fruitful subject of discussion.
There were things which Ethel thought should
be said to Mrs. Trenton. She even considered asking
Dr. Ridgely to say them,&mdash;a proposition which Grace
derided and Mrs. Durland did not encourage. Ethel
was further inspired with the idea that a committee
of the best women of the city should wait upon Mrs.
Trenton and try to convince her of the dangerous
character of the doctrines she was advocating.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking it altogether too seriously,&#8221; said
Grace. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose that woman&#8217;s ever made a
single convert. About so many people have always
held her ideas&mdash;about marriage and things like that.
The real radicals probably look on her as a huge joke.
A woman who visits at Newport and goes cruising on
yachts doesn&#8217;t just put herself clear outside the social
breastworks. There are other, women besides Mrs.
Trenton who talk free love and birth control and
things like that just for the excitement and the attention
they get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They should be locked up, every one of them!&#8221;
Ethel declared. &#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed for our city that she
can come here and be received by people you&#8217;d expect
better things of, and be allowed to speak. The police
should stop it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she can&#8217;t ruin the town with one lecture,&#8221;
Grace replied good-naturedly. &#8220;The Twentieth Century
Club brings all sorts of lunatics here and the
members are about the most conservative people in
town. You couldn&#8217;t change the minds of any of them
any more than you could knock over the soldiers&#8217;
monument with a feather duster.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Grace got excused from the store at five o&#8217;clock on
Tuesday to give herself ample time to prepare for the
dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the prettiest gown you ever wore, dear,&#8221;
Mrs. Durland exclaimed when Grace was fully arrayed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t have your hair marcelled;
that little natural wave is prettier than anything the
hairdresser could do. Carried straight away from
your forehead as you&#8217;ve got it gives just the right
effect. I guess Miss Reynolds needn&#8217;t be ashamed
of you. You&#8217;ve got the look of breeding, Grace; nobody
could fail to see that. Just be careful not to
talk too much, not even if Mrs. Trenton says brash
things you feel like disputing with her. And if you
get a chance to speak to Judge Sanders without appearing
to drag it in you might say you&#8217;re the great-granddaughter
of Josiah B. Morley. Little things like
that do count, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; Grace assented, as she studied
the hang of her skirt before the mirror.</p>

<p>Ethel came in and seated herself on the bed to
watch Grace&#8217;s preparations. Osgood Haley had
walked home with her and she was in the mood of subdued
exaltation to which the young man&#8217;s company
frequently brought her. She apologized to her mother
for being late; she and Osgood had prolonged the
walk by taking a turn in the park but she would make
up to her for the delay by doing all of the supper
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;That dress really is becoming to you, Grace,&#8221; she
said in a fervor of magnanimity. &#8220;It sets you off
beautifully. You must tell us all about the party. I
hope you won&#8217;t let anything I said about Mrs. Trenton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
spoil the evening for you. You know I&#8217;m always glad
when any happiness comes to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Ethel; I guess I&#8217;ll live through the
ordeal,&#8221; said Grace from her dressing table where she
had seated herself to administer the final touches to
her toilet. Zealous to be of service, Ethel and her
mother watched her attentively, offering suggestions
to which Grace in her absorption murmured replies or
ignored. Ethel brought from her room a prized lace-bordered
handkerchief which she insisted that Grace
should carry. Her generosity was spoiled somewhat
by the self-sacrificing air with which it was tendered.
To help others was really the great joy of life, Ethel
quoted Haley as saying, adding that she constantly
marveled at Osgood&#8217;s clear vision of the true way of
life. Grace accepted the handkerchief, with difficulty
concealing a smile at the change in Ethel wrought by
Haley&#8217;s talk.</p>

<p>The car Miss Reynolds had sent was at the door and
Mrs. Durland and Ethel went down to see Grace off.
They gave her a final looking over before helping her
into her coat. The veil she had drawn over her head
required readjustment; it was a serious question
whether there was not an infinitesimal spot on one of
her slippers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ve got to take me as I am!&#8221; said Grace,
finally. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t time to dress all over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait up for you, dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be anxious to know all about the dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was again torn by doubts as the car bore her
swiftly toward Miss Reynolds&#8217;s. She tried to convince
herself that she was not in the least interested in Mrs.
Trenton; that she was no more concerned with her
than she would have been with any other woman she
might meet in the house of a friend. But these attempts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
to minimize her curiosity as to Trenton&#8217;s wife
failed miserably. It was impossible to think of the
meeting with her lover&#8217;s wife as a trifling incident.
The newspaper portraits of Mrs. Trenton rose vividly
before her and added to her discomfort. She feared
that she might in some way betray herself. When
the car stopped she felt strongly impelled to postpone
her entrance in the hope of quieting herself by walking
round the block; but to be late to a dinner was, she
knew, an unpardonable sin. Summoning all her courage
she ran up the walk to the door, which opened before
she could ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;First room to the right upstairs,&#8221; said the colored
butler.</p>

<p>The white maid helped her off with her wrap and
stood by watching her with frank admiration as she
surveyed herself before a long mirror. In Grace&#8217;s
perturbed state of mind the presence of the girl was
a comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I look all right?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look lovely, Miss; just like a beautiful picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; said Grace, smiling gratefully into
the girl&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Am I very late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Miss, Dr. and Mrs. Ridgely haven&#8217;t come
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>A clock on the mantle began striking the half hour
as Grace left the room. She went down slowly with
a curious sense of being an unbidden guest in a strange
house.</p>

<p>From the stair she caught a glimpse of a man in
evening dress in the room below. She had attended
few functions in her life where men wore evening
dress and the staring expanse of shirt front intensified
her sense of breathing an alien atmosphere.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>As she stood in the drawing room doorway the
figures within dimmed and she put out her hand to
steady herself. Then the wavering mists that blurred
her vision cleared as Miss Reynolds came quickly
forward and caught her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, I didn&#8217;t hear you come down!
I&#8217;m glad to see you,&mdash;even relieved!&#8221; she added in a
whisper. &#8220;How perfectly adorable you are!&#8221; Grace
had not dared lift her eyes to the group of guests
who stood across the room talking animatedly, and
as Miss Reynolds, with her arm about Grace&#8217;s waist,
moved toward them she was arrested by a young man
who had just entered and stood waiting to present
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Atwood! Miss Durland, Mr. Atwood.&#8221;
Jimmie Atwood put out his hand, smiling joyfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck, I call this! It&#8217;s perfectly bully to
meet you again, Miss Durland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You two are acquainted?&#8221; Miss Reynolds exclaimed
delightedly. &#8220;That&#8217;s splendid, for you&#8217;re to
take Miss Durland in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Atwood&#8217;s equal to the most difficult situations,&#8221;
said Grace, meeting his eyes, which were responding
to the mirth in her own as both recalled the
night they had met at McGovern&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! You have a secret of some kind!&#8221; said Miss
Reynolds. &#8220;Far be it from me to intrude but you&#8217;ve
got to meet the other guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmie Atwood&#8217;s appearance had lessened the tension
for Grace and quite composedly she found herself
confronting a tall slender woman who stepped
forward to meet the newcomers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Trenton, Miss Durland&mdash;and Mr. Atwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenton gave each a quick little nod, murmuring:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ridgelys at this moment arrived followed by
two unattached men. Townsend, a young physician
who was looked upon as a coming man, and Professor
Grayling, whose courses in sociology Grace
had taken at the University. He was, she learned, a
remote connection of Miss Reynolds&#8217;s and had been
summoned from Bloomington to add to the representative
character of the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ever tell me you knew Miss Reynolds?&#8221;
Grayling demanded, as he and Grace were
left to themselves for a moment during the progress
of further introductions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t meet her till after I left college. I
know why you&#8217;re invited; you&#8217;re here to do the
heavy high-brow work! I remember that you once
expressed views on the writings of the guest of honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I? If I become quarrelsome tonight throw a
plate or something at me.&#8221; Grace had always admired
Grayling; he was saying now that she had been
his star student and that he missed her from his
classes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d really counted on making you an instructor in
my department but you left without saying good-bye;
and here I find you launched upon a high social
career&mdash;it&#8217;s a distinct loss to social science!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you knew just where and how I met Miss Reynolds
you wouldn&#8217;t think me in danger of becoming
a social butterfly!&#8221; laughed Grace, her assurance
mounting. Grayling was smiling quizzically into her
eyes; he would never know how grateful she was for
these few minutes with him. The rest of the company
were grouped about Mrs. Trenton, who had
lately been in Washington and was expressing her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
opinions, which were not apparently complimentary,
of the public men she had met there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Number Eighteen at Shipley&#8217;s,&#8221; said Grace,
finding that Grayling was giving her his complete attention.
&#8220;Miss Reynolds was my first customer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You&#8217;re collecting data! I
see it all! There will be a treatise, perhaps a large
tome, on your experiences in the haunts of trade.
Perhaps you&#8217;ll allow me to write the preface. We
thought down at the University you&#8217;d got tired of us,
but I see that you&#8217;d grown beyond our feeble aid. I&#8217;m
infinitely relieved!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop kidding me!&#8221; said Grace, glancing about to
make sure they were not overheard. &#8220;I&#8217;m a shop girl,
trying to earn an honest living.&#8221;</p>

<p>Atwood came up as dinner was announced and when
they reached the table Grace found that Grayling
was to sit at her left. Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s place was a
little to her right on the further side, an arrangement
that made it possible for Grace to observe her without
falling within the direct line of her vision.</p>

<p>Grace, turning to Atwood, who frankly declared his
purpose to monopolize her, found it possible to study
at leisure the woman about whom she had so constantly
speculated. Mrs. Trenton was, she surmised,
nearly the forty years to which Trenton himself confessed
and there was in her large gray-blue eyes
something of the look of weariness to be found in the
eyes of people who live upon excitement and sensation.
Her hair had a reddish tinge and the gray had
begun to show in it. She bore every mark which to
a sophisticated feminine inspection announces that a
woman has a particular care for her appearance. She
gave an impression of smoothness and finish. She
wore a string of pearls and on her left hand a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
pearl set in diamonds, but no wedding ring, a fact
which Grace interpreted as signifying that in this
fashion the author of &#8220;Clues to a New Social Order,&#8221;
let the world know her indifference to the traditional
symbol by which womankind advertise their married
state. She found herself wondering whether Ward
Trenton had given his wife the necklace or the ring
with the diamond-encircled pearl. Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s
gown had the metropolitan accent; it was the product
unmistakably of one of those ultra smart New York
dressmakers whose advertisements Grace had noted
from time to time in magazines for women.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenton had entered into a discussion with
Dr. Ridgely of the industrial conditions created by the
war; and she was repeating what some diplomat had
said to her at a dinner in Washington. Her head and
shoulders moved almost constantly as she talked, and
her hands seemed never idle, playing with her beads
or fingering a spoon she had unconsciously chosen as
a plaything. She laughed frequently, a quick, nervous,
mirthless little laugh, while her eyes stared vacantly,
as though she were not fully conscious of what she
said or what was being said to her. She spoke crisply,
with the effect of biting off her words. Grace was interested
in her mastery of the broad <i>a</i>, which western
folk profess to scorn but nevertheless envy in pilgrims
from the fabled East. Her voice and enunciation reminded
Grace of the speech an English woman who
had once lectured at the University.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was evidently a pet expression, uttered with a
shrug and a lifting of the brows. It meant much or
nothing as the hearer chose to take it. Grace had
read much about the neurotic American woman and
Mrs. Trenton undoubtedly expressed the type. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
difficult to think of her as Ward Trenton&#8217;s wife. The
two were irreconcilably different. Grace&#8217;s mind
wearied in the attempt to correlate them, but she
gained ease as the moments sped by. By the time
the meat course was served the talk had become general.
Every one wished to hear Mrs. Trenton and she
met in a fashion of her own the questions that were
directed at her. Evidently she was used to being questioned
and she answered indifferently, sometimes disdainfully,
or turned the question upon the inquirer.</p>

<p>Atwood was exerting himself to hold Grace&#8217;s attention.
He had never heard of Mary Graham Trenton
till Miss Reynolds&#8217;s invitation sent him to the
newspapers for information. He was not sure now
that he knew just how she came to be a celebrity and
with Grace beside him he didn&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wild to see you ever since that night we
put on the little sketch at Mac&#8217;s,&#8221; he said confidingly.
&#8220;You were perfectly grand; never saw a finer piece of
good sportsmanship. I met Evelyn the next day and
we&#8217;ve talked about it ever since when we&#8217;ve been alone.
But old Bob is certainly sore! He&#8217;s really a good fellow,
you know; but he was off his game that night.
You scored big with Evelyn. She was really hurt
when you refused her invitation to dinner. I was to
be in the party&mdash;begged for an invitation; I swear I
did! Please let me pull a party pretty soon&mdash;say at
the Country Club, and ask the Cummingses. Really
I&#8217;m respectable! I&#8217;ve got regular parents and aunts
and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to consider that. Please listen; this is
growing interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My point, Mrs. Trenton,&#8221; Professor Grayling was
saying, &#8220;is just this: Your reform programme only
touches the top of the social structure without regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
to the foundation and the intermediate framework.
In your &#8216;Clues to a New Social Order&#8217; you consider
how things might be&mdash;a happy state of things if the
transition could be effected suddenly. Granting that
what you would accomplish is desirable or essential
to the general happiness of mankind, we can&#8217;t just
pick out the few things we are particularly interested
in and set them up alone. They&#8217;d be sure to topple
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; Mrs. Trenton replied; and then as
though aware that something more was expected of
her she went on: &#8220;But a lot of changes have come
in&mdash;in what you scientific economists would call the
less important things. Just now I&#8217;m laying stress on
an equal wage for men and women for the same labor.
That I think more important than such things as more
liberal divorce laws, though I favor both. As to divorce&#8221;&mdash;she
gave her characteristic shrug,&mdash;&#8220;we all
know that more liberal laws came as the result of
changing conditions&mdash;the new attitude toward marriage
and all that. We&#8217;re in the midst of a tremendous
social evolution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come in right here for a moment, Mrs.
Trenton?&#8221; asked Dr. Ridgely. &#8220;You plead in your
book for a change of existing laws to make marriage
dissoluble at the will or whim of the contracting
parties; children to be turned over to the State&mdash;a
direct blow at the family. Do you really think that
desirable?&#8221; he ended smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! That idea didn&#8217;t originate with me,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;I merely went into it a little more
concretely perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, her curious vacant stare, followed in an instant
by a gesture, the slightest lifting and closing
of one of her graceful hands as though her thoughts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
having ranged infinity, had brought back something
it was not necessary in her immediate surroundings to
disclose.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; the minister insisted, &#8220;would such a solution
be wise? Do you, honestly, think it desirable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s coming; it&#8217;s inevitable!&#8221; she answered quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many women can you imagine driving up to
a big barracks and checking their babies? How strong
is the maternal instinct?&#8221; asked Judge Sanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most mothers don&#8217;t know how to care for their
children,&#8221; said Mrs. Trenton, bending forward to
glance at the speaker. Sanders was a big man with
a great shock of iron-gray hair. He was regarding
Mrs. Trenton with the bland smile that witnesses always
found disconcerting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that may be true,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the poor
old human race has survived their ignorance a mighty
long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The laughter at this retort was scattering and tempered
by the obvious fact that Mrs. Trenton was not
wholly pleased by it.</p>

<p>Jimmie Atwood was hoping that there would be a
row. A row among high-brows would be something to
talk about when he went to the University Club the
next day for lunch and an afternoon of sniff.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea is, I take it,&#8221; he said with his funny
squeak, &#8220;that there would be no aunts or in-laws; just
plain absolute freedom for everybody. Large marble
orphan asylums all over the country. Spanking machines
and everything scientific!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got exactly the right idea,&#8221; cried Mrs.
Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clubs for women and clubs for men; everybody
would live in a club. That <i>would</i> be jolly!&#8221; Atwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
continued, delighted that he had gained the attention
of the guest of honor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has anybody here,&#8221; began Grayling, &#8220;ever watched
a bunch of college boys listening to a phonograph
record of Patti singing &#8216;Home, Sweet Home?&#8217; Well, I
have and you could cut the gloom with a knife. Home
is still sweet to most of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be awfully sorry to miss the weddings we have
at the parsonage,&#8221; said Mrs. Ridgely;&mdash;&#8220;trusting
young souls who pop in at all hours to be married.
They&#8217;re all <i>sure</i> they&#8217;re going to live happy forever
after. Miss Durland, it&#8217;s your generation that&#8217;s got
to solve the problem. Maybe you have the answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think weddings are <i>beautiful</i>!&#8221; Grace answered,
feeling the eyes of the company upon her.
The girlish ardor she threw into her words won her a
laugh of sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them intimidate you,&#8221; said Mrs. Trenton
with an indulgent smile. &#8220;Miss Reynolds has been
telling me that you&#8217;re a University girl and you ought
to be sound on the great questions if Professor Grayling
hasn&#8217;t spoiled you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one could spoil Grace,&#8221; Grayling protested.</p>

<p>Grace pondered, anxious for Miss Reynolds&#8217;s sake
to say nothing stupid. She was the youngest member
of the company; they were merely trying in a friendly
spirit to bring her into the talk and no wise deliverance
would be expected of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare speak for all my generation,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but something <i>has</i> occurred to me. Our
elders scold us too much! It isn&#8217;t at all pleasant to
be told that we&#8217;re terribly wicked; that we haven&#8217;t
any of the fine qualities of our parents and grandparents.
We hear nothing except how times have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
changed; well, we didn&#8217;t change them! I positively
refuse to be held responsible for changing anything!
I took the world just as I found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had spoken quickly, with the ring of honest
protest in her voice, and she was abashed when Judge
Sanders clapped his hands in approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the truest word I&#8217;ve heard on that subject,&#8221;
he said heartily. &#8220;The responsibility is on us
old folks if our children are not orderly, disciplined,
useful members of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re right,&#8221; added Dr. Ridgely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you the Miss Durland that John Moore
talks about?&#8221; Mrs. Sanders asked. &#8220;I thought so!
Isn&#8217;t John a wonderful fellow? Since he went into
Mr. Sanders&#8217;s office we&#8217;ve seen him a good deal at
our house. He&#8217;s so simple and honest and gives promise
of great things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very stupid,&#8221; said Sanders; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize
that I had met the paragon Moore brags about so
much; but I might have known it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He began describing Moore, and told the whole table
how, as trustee of the University, he had become
acquainted with the young man and was so struck by
his fine qualities that he had taken him into his office.
He related some of the familiar anecdotes of Moore
and called upon Grace for others. Grace told her
stories well, wholly forgetting herself in her enthusiasm.
Suddenly her gaze fell upon Mrs. Trenton,
whose lips were parted in a smile of well-bred inattention.
Grace became confused, stammered, cut short a
story she was telling illustrative of John&#8217;s kindness
to a negro student whom he had nursed through a long
illness. Apparently neither John nor his philanthropic
impulses interested the author of &#8220;Clues to a New Social
Order&#8221;; or she was irritated at being obliged to relinquish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
first place at the table. Miss Reynolds, quick
to note the bored look on her guest&#8217;s face, tactfully
brought her again into the foreground. Grace was
startled a moment later, when, as the talk again became
general, Sanders remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;ve met your husband, Mrs. Trenton.
He&#8217;s a friend of Mr. Thomas Kemp, one of our principal
manufacturers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she replied carelessly. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve heard
Mr. Trenton speak of an Indianapolis client of that
name. He visits your city I know, on professional
employments. Indeed his business keeps him in
motion most of the time; but I can&#8217;t complain; I&#8217;m a
good deal of a gad-about myself! I wired for Mr.
Trenton&#8217;s address to his New York office the other
day, hoping I might be able to see him somewhere.
It&#8217;s possible he may turn up here. There&#8217;s a case for
you, Dr. Ridgely! The reason my marriage is so successful
is because of the broad freedom Mr. Trenton
and I allow each other. We haven&#8217;t met since&mdash;Heaven
knows when!&#8221;</p>

<p>A slight hint of bravado in her tone suggested an
anxiety to establish herself in the minds of the company
as the possessor of a wider freedom and a nobler
tolerance than other wives. The other wives at the
table were obviously embarrassed if not displeased
by her declaration. It seemed to Grace that the air
of the room chilled perceptibly.</p>

<p>She found herself resenting Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s manner
of speaking of her husband. Trenton, she remembered,
had always spoken of his wife in kind terms.
On the evening of their first meeting at The Shack
he had chivalrously taken upon himself the responsibility
for the failure of his marriage. He had spoken
of Mrs. Trenton as a charming woman, but Grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
thought her singularly charmless. She was at no pains
to make herself agreeable to the company Miss Reynolds
had assembled in her honor. One thing was
clear and Grace derived a deep satisfaction from the
reflection,&mdash;Mrs. Trenton not only didn&#8217;t love her husband,
but she was incapable of loving any one but
herself. Grace, having accepted the invitation to meet
Mrs. Trenton with a sense that there was something
a little brazen in her going when Miss Reynolds believed
her to be a clean-hearted, high-minded girl, in
bitterness of spirit yielded to a mood of defiance.
This woman had no right to be a burden and a
hindrance to the man she had married. It was her
fault if he found in another the love and the companionship
she had denied or was incapable of giving
him.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The Twentieth Century Club had made the occasion
a guest night and the hall was well filled when Miss
Reynolds&#8217;s party arrived. Places had been reserved
for them near the platform but Grace slipped into a
seat by the door with Atwood and Grayling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for this!&#8221; exclaimed Atwood. &#8220;I always
sleep at lectures and I won&#8217;t be so conspicuous
back here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenton, introduced by the president as one of
the foremost women of her time, laid a sheaf of notes
on the reading desk and began her address. Her subject
was &#8220;Woman&#8217;s New Freedom,&#8221; and she summarized
the long struggle for suffrage before indicating
the questions to which women should now devote
themselves to complete their victory. She recited the
familiar arguments against child labor and thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
existing laws should be extended and strengthened;
and she pleaded for equal pay for equal work for
women. She advocated uniform marriage and divorce
laws on a basis of the widest freedom. There was no
slavery so hideous as that of marriages where the tie
becomes irksome. She favored birth control on the
ground that a woman is entitled to be the judge of her
fitness and ability to bear and raise children. She
advocated state maternity hospitals with provision for
the care of all children by the state where parents
lack the means or the intelligence to rear them. She
was not a socialist, she protested, though there were
many socialistic ideas which she believed could profitably
be adopted under the present form of government.
Her &#8220;Clues to a New Social Order,&#8221; she explained,
contemplated the fullest recognition of the
rights of the individual. She expressed her impatience
of the multiplication of laws to make mankind better;
the widest liberty was essential to all progress.</p>

<p>Grace had listened with the strictest attention.
Once or twice Grayling whispered some comment and
Atwood, deeply bored, inquired midway of the address
whether the first inning wasn&#8217;t nearly over. At the
conclusion the president, following the club&#8217;s custom,
said that Mrs. Trenton would be glad to answer any
questions, but the only person who took advantage of
the invitation was an elderly gentleman who asked
Mrs. Trenton whether she didn&#8217;t think the Eighteenth
Amendment marked a great moral advance for the
nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, a decided retreat,&#8221; Mrs. Trenton
replied, so incisively that the meeting closed amid general
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it the event of a life-time?&#8221; Atwood asked
Grayling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>&#8220;Old stuff! Miss Durland could have taken the
lady&#8217;s material and made a better story of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A doubtful compliment!&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;Come
along; we must say good-night to Miss Reynolds.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went forward to where the other guests stood
waiting while the club president introduced to Mrs.
Trenton such of the members as wished to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;m taking you home,&#8221; said Atwood.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my reward for coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace had hoped to avoid speaking to Mrs. Trenton
again but as Miss Reynolds&#8217;s other guests were bidding
her good-night she couldn&#8217;t very well escape it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you stayed to the bitter end!&#8221; Mrs. Trenton
exclaimed with a forced brightening of her face. The
hand she gave Grace was cold, and the look of weariness
in her eyes was intensified. &#8220;I wish we might
have you as a convert. No hope, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away with a smile to greet the next in
line.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t so shocking after all,&#8221; remarked Miss
Reynolds, as Grace bade her good-night. &#8220;I&#8217;ll always
remember this, Grace. You helped a lot&mdash;you&#8217;d have
helped a lot even if you hadn&#8217;t said a word! I was so
proud of you, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she reached home Grace found her mother
and Ethel waiting up for her and she sat down in the
living room to recount the events of the evening.
Mrs. Trenton, she said, was not so terrible; she dismissed
her lightly and concentrated upon the other
guests at the dinner. She was at pains to give the
impression that she had thoroughly enjoyed herself,
particularly her meeting with Professor Grayling. The
fact, carelessly mentioned, that Jimmie Atwood had
brought her home immediately obscured everything
else. Mrs. Durland wished to be sure that Jimmie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
was the son of the George Rogers Atwood who had
made a fortune in the stove business; Ethel thought
he was only a nephew and that Jimmie&#8217;s father
operated coal mines somewhere near Terre Haute.
Grace, unable to assist in determining this momentous
matter, left them and sought the seclusion of her room.</p>

<p>As she closed the door she was oppressed by an
overmastering fatigue; she felt that innumerable,
mocking, menacing hands were plucking at her. The
jealousy that had assailed her fitfully all evening now
tore at her heart. A vast loneliness, as of some bleak
unhorizoned waste, settled upon her. She locked her
door and spread out on her dressing table the sheets of
Trenton&#8217;s last letter, which had reached her that
morning, and read them over as she brushed her hair.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... and there is no hour in which I do not think
of you. The thought of you is like a prayer in my
heart. You have touched the best in me. I rebel
against the fate that keeps me from you. Sometimes
it becomes intolerable&mdash;I want you so much, <i>now</i>&mdash;just
to see your face, to look into your eyes, to touch
your hand. You are the flower of all the world, I
think, and quick upon that comes a sense that you
have greatness in you; that you are stronger than I
am&mdash;possess a truer and broader sense of the meaning
of life....</p>
</div>

<p>Her deep sigh as she finished became a sob and
she laid her head upon her arms and the tears came.
It was possible that he had written just such letters
to the woman who was still his wife; that once he
had found in her this same exaltation.</p>

<p>But these thoughts she fought and conquered. As
she moved slowly about her room with its dingy old-fashioned
furniture, its odds and ends of memorabilia&mdash;her
high school diploma, framed; a University pennant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
hung over the mahogany bed,&mdash;she slipped back
into her youth and her heart went out to Trenton with
a child-like faith and confidence. The remembrance
of him as he had held her and kissed her; his tenderness,
the wistfulness with which he regarded her at
times, his fine considerateness, the utter lack of anything
common or coarse in him&mdash;these memories
wrought peace in her heart.</p>

<p>Ready for bed, she huddled inside the window
draperies before opening her window, gazing up at the
stars. The same bright orbs shone over him, wherever
he was. Perhaps at that very moment, he, in
the manner of lovers from time immemorial, was
invoking their council as he thought of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you! I love you, dear!&#8221; she whispered and
repeated the words, finding in them strength and
solace.</p>

<p>She unlocked the door and got into bed just as her
mother entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you all right, Grace?&#8221; Mrs. Durland asked.
She stooped and picked up Grace&#8217;s party slippers from
the middle of the floor and put them away in the
closet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m fine, mother,&#8221; Grace answered. &#8220;Please
don&#8217;t bother about my things. I&#8217;ll straighten up in the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put your
dress on a hanger in the sewing room and press the
skirt out tomorrow. It&#8217;s mussed a little, I noticed.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the gown over her arm she walked to the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you happy, dear?&#8221; she asked, laying her hand
for a moment on the girl&#8217;s forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother. Thank you so much for coming in!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>With an access of emotion she sat up and flung her
arms about her mother&#8217;s neck and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> happy, Grace?&#8221; Mrs. Durland repeated
solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother; very happy.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning paper&#8217;s account of Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s lecture
came in for discussion at the breakfast table and
Mrs. Durland read aloud the society column&#8217;s report
of Miss Reynolds&#8217;s dinner. The names of the guests
were not given, an omission which Mrs. Durland
thought singular, but which evoked from Ethel the
comment that the people who had countenanced Mrs.
Trenton merely to please Miss Reynolds probably
had asked to have their names suppressed. Durland,
deprived of his paper, which Mrs. Durland and Ethel
were clinging to in violation of his long-established
rights, asked Grace whether Trenton was in town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Trenton said she had hoped to see him here,
but I don&#8217;t know anything about it, daddy,&#8221; she replied
carelessly, though the possibility of Trenton&#8217;s
coming to Indianapolis in response to his wife&#8217;s summons
was now uppermost in her thoughts.</p>

<p>She eagerly opened the letter from him which
awaited her at the store. It was a hasty lead-pencil
scrawl and said that he was leaving that night for
Indianapolis to see Mrs. Trenton, who was lecturing
there and had asked for a meeting. The summons was
most inopportune as his work in Syracuse was not
completed and it would be necessary for him to return
as quickly as possible. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll see you, of course,
if only for a moment,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

<p>The note served only to revive with keener malevolence
the jealousy that she had vanquished the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
previous night. Trenton had never written so
brusquely before; perhaps his wife&#8217;s demand for an
interview had alarmed him. She stabbed herself with
the thought that this woman had the right to demand
interviews with him whenever she pleased.</p>

<p>In the search for consolation she asked Irene to go
to lunch with her. To her relief, Irene, having already
formed at long range her opinion of Mrs. Trenton,
asked only a few questions about the dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having seen Mary you will understand Ward better,&#8221;
Irene remarked, after her curiosity had been satisfied
as to what the women wore and she had suggested
that the meeting with Atwood under Miss Reynolds&#8217;s
roof might lead to something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward&#8217;s coming here to see her; he may be in town
now,&#8221; said Grace, not in the least interested in Atwood.
&#8220;She told us at dinner she hadn&#8217;t seen her
husband for she didn&#8217;t know how long and had been
wiring to try to locate him. What do you make of
that, Irene? Do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d suppose nothing! You can&#8217;t tell what women
of that sort think or what they&#8217;ll do. But you can be
pretty sure they&#8217;ll do something foolish every chance
they get. Don&#8217;t you worry about her; you can trust
Ward to take care of you no matter what her ladyship
knows or guesses about him. If Ward loves you as I
think he does he&#8217;ll go clear down the line for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that,&mdash;do you really mean that,&#8221;
asked Grace tremulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I mean it! Look here, my dear! Seeing
that woman has made you nervous. If you&#8217;d
asked my advice in advance I&#8217;d have told you not to
go. But now that you went and gone and done it the
sooner you forget the whole business the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene, I simply had to go! I was simply dying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
of curiosity and jealousy. Can&#8217;t you understand that?
You needn&#8217;t tell me I ought to be ashamed of myself
for going; I know well enough I ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out, old dear! I&#8217;d probably have done the
same thing myself if I&#8217;d been in your place. Why,
Grace, the first time Mrs. Kemp appeared on my floor
after I began playing around with Tommy, I nearly
broke my neck to wait on her. You ought to feel better
now you&#8217;ve seen the woman. I heard some of our
valued customers talking about the lecture this morning
and they all knocked. It&#8217;s her money they listen
to, not her ideas. She&#8217;s no rival of yours, my dear.
But, <i>speaking</i> of rivals, I&#8217;ve been keeping something
from you. Good old John Moore has called on me
twice lately and I went to a movie with him Saturday
night. Honest, I did! Don&#8217;t faint, but I actually
broke a date with Tommy to see a picture with your
old college chum! Go on and scold me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Irene, I&#8217;m awfully pleased. John liked you
from the first time you met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he oughtn&#8217;t to! Really it would be a lot better
if you&#8217;d warn him against me. He&#8217;s so square himself
that he refuses to believe anything mean of anybody;
and if he should fall in love with me&mdash;or worse&mdash;if
I&#8217;d get a case on <i>him</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head and compressed her lips to indicate
the dire possibilities of either predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Grace demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly; you know why not,&#8221; Irene replied.
&#8220;He thinks I&#8217;m straight and you know I&#8217;m&mdash;well, you
know what you know. And I just wouldn&#8217;t fool that
man! If I did I&#8217;d be punished for it and I&#8217;d deserve
to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Irene!&#8221; exclaimed Grace. &#8220;I believe you&#8217;re
already in love with him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;Well, hardly <i>that</i>,&#8221; Irene replied reflectively, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ve got one of the symptoms. I&#8217;m going to quit my
evil ways and chuck Tommy! Old sackcloth and
ashes stuff! I ought to have let him go when we had
the row about that girl in Chicago. You know, Grace,
we&#8217;re always hearing about the influence of a good
woman, but, my dear, it&#8217;s nothing to what a good man
can do! I suppose,&#8221; she went on in her large philosophic
manner, &#8220;it&#8217;s because really fine men are so
scarce that when you do spot one you just naturally
feel like prostrating yourself in the dust before him.
When I began lotus-eating with Tommy I thought I&#8217;d
never weary of the food, but John&#8217;s given me an appetite
for corn bread and cabbage! Just what will
you take for your interest in John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never could have loved John and he&#8217;s never
thought of me in that way,&#8221; Grace replied seriously.
&#8220;But, Irene, for his friendship I wouldn&#8217;t take a
million dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you wouldn&#8217;t! And just for his respect
and confidence, I&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace marvelled to see tears in Irene&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>The hour spent with Irene served at least to change
the current of Grace&#8217;s thoughts. There were other girl
friends for whom she had a warm liking but Irene
continued to hold first place in her affections. The
girl&#8217;s poise and serenity, her flashes of wisdom, made
her increasingly fascinating. And there was a charm
in her very unaccountableness. That the luxury-loving
Irene, who had so recently spoken of marriage as
only a means of attaining comfort and ease, should
tolerate the attentions of a young countryman who
stood at the threshold of one of the most difficult professions
was all but incredible. But this was no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
puzzling than the attraction John apparently found in
Irene.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon Grace was again
enmeshed in a network of doubt and apprehension.
Trenton was making a journey for the express purpose
of meeting his wife; he had probably reached
Indianapolis at noon and gone at once to Miss Reynolds&#8217;s
to see her. Grace&#8217;s imagination was playing
cruel tricks upon her; she pictured the meeting between
Trenton and his wife in a hundred ways. He
would kiss her, perhaps take her into his arms; and
after their long separation it was possible that both
might experience a reawakening of the early passion
that had died in them. Grace, seeking the lowest
depths of humility, knew herself only as Number
Eighteen at Shipley&#8217;s, a girl to be played with and
cast aside by another woman&#8217;s husband whenever it
pleased him to be done with her. In her self-abasement
she recalled Irene&#8217;s oft-reiterated declaration
about Kemp, that she admired his brains and was
fond of him but never deceived herself with the idea
that she loved him. This was the wiser way. Grace
lashed herself pitilessly for her folly in giving her love
so unreservedly when the result could bring nothing
but unhappiness. Her love and trust wavered like
sunlight struggling to penetrate a field of cloud.</p>

<p>She was standing near the entrance to the ready-to-wear
department, inattentive and listless, when the
rattle of the elevator door roused her and Trenton
stepped out. At the sight of him the blood rushed to
her heart till it seemed for a moment that she would
die of joy at the sight of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>He saw her at once and walked quickly toward her.
He had never before seemed so handsome and distinguished.
His step had the elasticity of youth, and
there was a happy light in his eyes as he took her
hand. This was the first time he had sought her at
Shipley&#8217;s and she assumed that his coming meant that
he had seized the only possible moment to see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t talk here, of course; I&#8217;ve got Kemp&#8217;s
car and I can explain things as we ride,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Can you get excused for the rest of the day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Boardman, busily marking price tags, gave
the permission with an absent-minded nod and Grace
hurried back to report that she was free and would get
her wraps and meet him at the main entrance.</p>

<p>When they were in Kemp&#8217;s limousine Trenton
ordered Craig to drive straight north, without mentioning
a destination. There was no hint of trouble
in his clear steady eyes. His air of perfect self-confidence,
of knowing exactly what he was about, restored
her faith. She loved him and she was proud that she
loved him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be frightened!&#8221; he began, clasping
her hand when they were clear of the down-town
traffic. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just seen Mrs. Trenton. She wired me
for an appointment to discuss some of her personal
business matters. As she&#8217;s going further West lecturing
it was as convenient to see her here as anywhere
else. So I came here and have already seen her at
Miss Reynolds&#8217;s. It took some time to go over her
investments and explain some changes I had made in
them. When that was finished she suddenly asked
about that letter I wrote to her last fall from St.
Louis. That settled the question as to whether she
ever got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember,&#8221; Grace replied faintly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>In spite of his cheerfulness she was sure that he was
leading up to some disagreeable disclosure and involuntarily
she drew away her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, dear,&#8221; he went on reassuringly. &#8220;She
said she knew we&#8217;d been drifting further apart for
a long time and that she wasn&#8217;t surprised by my
letter. She hadn&#8217;t acknowledged it because she was
waiting for a chance to see me to talk it out. She
seemed rather amused. She has a way of being
amused at things. And now&mdash;don&#8217;t jump!&#8221; he caught
her hand and clasped it tight. &#8220;She was always a
woman of surprises&mdash;she said she wanted to see the
girl I had mentioned&mdash;but not in a disagreeable way
at all. If you knew her you&#8217;d understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&mdash;I do understand,&#8221; Grace replied slowly.
&#8220;I was at the dinner Miss Reynolds gave for her last
night. I ought to have asked you if it was all right
to go&mdash;but I was afraid you&#8217;d say no&mdash;and&mdash;and I
<i>had</i> to see her.&#8221; Her voice broke in a sob, but lifting
her head she hurried on. &#8220;I was jealous&mdash;terribly
jealous&mdash;and something tells me that&mdash;that&mdash;we are&mdash;near
the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, dear; don&#8217;t give way to foolish fears!&#8221; he
implored. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you went to the dinner; that was
all right and I want to hear all about it later. Having
seen Mrs. Trenton you ought to know that her
request is quite characteristic. Don&#8217;t you see that
she&#8217;s curious about you, just as you were about her!
I really think she means to be kind to me. It&#8217;s unusual
of course, but&mdash;Mrs. Trenton is a very unusual
woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace looked at him in a kind of dumb wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you told her my name&mdash;&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; certainly not! You weren&#8217;t mentioned. I
think she assumed that the girl I wrote her about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
lived in St. Louis. She was rather taken aback when
I said she lived here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you told her you&#8217;d produce me&mdash;exhibit me
for her criticism? Ward, what can you be thinking
of; what can you think of <i>me</i> to ask such a thing? I
suppose you told her everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Grace, this isn&#8217;t like you! You&#8217;re taking it all
too seriously. Mrs. Trenton has no cause to think
anything except that I&#8217;ve met you and fallen in love
with you. You must be reasonable, dear,&#8221; he went on
patiently. &#8220;She knows nothing and has no right to
assume&mdash;what we&#8217;d rather she didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s just a
whim of hers. If I thought she wouldn&#8217;t treat you
as one lady should treat another I wouldn&#8217;t ask you
to go. It will be the most formal call&mdash;no chance for
anything unpleasant, even if she wanted to be disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She could be very disagreeable. I didn&#8217;t like her;
I didn&#8217;t like her at all! It seems to me sheer folly
to put myself in her way unnecessarily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you it will be all right!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;She
will be surprised, of course, to find that she has already
met you. You know I wouldn&#8217;t cause you the slightest
embarrassment or pain for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she pondered, her confidence in him
and her wish to accede to his wishes struggling against
suspicion and jealousy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure this isn&#8217;t a trick&mdash;a trap?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, dear! How can you think such a
thing? Mrs. Trenton really has a sense of humor;
and she&#8217;s a woman of the world. Besides she has no
ground whatever for attacking you; I can&#8217;t imagine
her doing that in any circumstances. I&#8217;m just meeting
her wish to see a girl I told her I admire. But&mdash;I
count more than I dare say on the result. I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
to give her a chance to practice what she preaches!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Grace, searching his eyes with a long
gaze, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go since you insist, but I think it&#8217;s foolish.
It&#8217;s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of! But
she can&#8217;t do more than murder me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t do more than approve of you!&#8221; he cried
and ordered Craig to drive to Miss Reynolds&#8217;s.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Mrs. Trenton was immediately visible, writing at a
small table in the living room, when they were ushered
into the reception parlor. She wore a pair of shell-rimmed
library glasses, and it occurred to Grace that
the blank stare that had been so disconcerting the
previous night was probably attributable to some defect
of vision. She did not lift her head when the maid
spoke to her but nodded and went on writing for several
minutes. Then she laid aside the glasses and
walked unhurriedly to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Ward, back again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;ve met Miss Durland, May,&#8221; said
Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; of course,&#8221; she replied with a smile of recognition
that faded instantly. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice of you to come,
Miss Durland. I didn&#8217;t know last night that you were
acquainted with Mr. Trenton. Dear Miss Reynolds
didn&#8217;t mention it or I should, of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke off in her odd way, her gaze wandering.
Her indifference was an achievement in itself, a masterly
thing. She wore a blue house gown of an exquisite
simplicity. A string of crystal beads hung
about her neck and she put her hand to them
frequently as though to make sure they were there.
As she sank into a chair her long figure relaxed into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
graceful lines. She was much more composed than at
the dinner, with a languorous composure that might
have been donned for the occasion like a garment.
She reminded Grace of those portraits of women done
by fashionable painters which satisfy the artistic sense
without conveying a sense of reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget, May, that I haven&#8217;t met Miss Reynolds,&#8221;
Trenton remarked to her; but she ignored him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are&mdash;what do you say&mdash;a Hoosier, Miss Durland?&#8221;
she asked, her gaze falling as if by chance
upon Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m a native.&#8221; Grace answered with
a faint smile; but her courage was ebbing. She hated
Mrs. Trenton. She tried to think of something amusing
to add to her confession that she was a native
Indianian but the atmosphere of the room was not
conducive to brilliancy. To make conversation Trenton
reminded his wife that they had once met a
certain senator from Indiana at White Sulphur
Springs.</p>

<p>A &#8220;yes&#8221; charged with all the apathy that can be
conveyed by the rising inflexion, was the only reply
that was evoked by this attempt to link Indiana to
large affairs of state. Trenton asked Grace whether
Indiana had ever produced more than one president,
and she tried to ease her discomfiture by replying
that the state had rather specialized in vice-presidents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; remarked Mrs. Trenton. &#8220;How very
droll! I suppose the Indiana school teacher has a
frightful time instilling in the young Hoosier mind the
names of all your vice-presidents. Do they pay
teachers well in Indiana?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so well as farther West, I believe,&#8221; Grace
answered; &#8220;but I know little about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the next thing I&#8217;m going to take up. I&#8217;m
having data collected now,&#8221; Mrs. Trenton said with
more spirit than she had before manifested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine, May,&#8221; said Trenton cordially. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a work worth doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d really approve of that, Ward?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t always been so indulgent of my whims.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace, increasingly uncomfortable, started when
Mrs. Trenton addressed her directly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Durland, if you see too much of Mr. Trenton
you will find him a singularly unreasonable person.
But,&#8221; with a shrug, &#8220;all men have the ancient
conceit of their sex superiority.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had drawled the &#8220;if you see too much&#8221; in a manner
to give the phrase a peculiar insinuating emphasis.
Grace caught its significance at once and her cheeks
burned; but she was less angry at the woman than at
Trenton, whose face betrayed no resentment. She
rose and walked to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, don&#8217;t run away!&#8221; Mrs. Trenton exclaimed.
&#8220;Miss Reynolds will be back shortly. She
was called away to some hospital&mdash;I think it was&mdash;to
see a friend. Do wait. There will be tea, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenton was on his feet. No man&#8217;s mind is ever
quite so agile or discerning as a woman&#8217;s. He had
just caught up with the phrase that had angered
Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept my word,&#8221; he said, rising and addressing
his wife directly. &#8220;When I promised you that if
I ever met a woman I felt I could care for I would
tell you, I was in earnest. At your own suggestion
and in perfect good faith I asked Miss Durland to
come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Ward! You were always a man of your
word!&#8221; she said with a hint of mockery in her voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
&#8220;I assure you that I&#8217;m delighted to meet Miss Durland.
She&#8217;s very charming, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend that you shall forget yourself!&#8221; he
said sharply. &#8220;Your conduct since you came into this
room has been contemptible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m most contrite! Do forgive me, Miss Durland.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay back in her chair in a pose of exaggerated
ease and lazily turned her head to look at Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I assume,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you are my chosen successor,
and I can&#8217;t complain of my husband&#8217;s taste.
You are very handsome and I can see how your youth
would appeal to him, but&mdash;there are things I must consider.
Please wait&#8221;&mdash;Grace had laid her hand on the
door,&mdash;&#8220;I may as well say it all now. I&#8217;ve probably
led Ward to think that if such an emergency as this
arose I&#8217;d free him and bid him Godspeed. But, you
see, confronted with the fact, I find it necessary to
think a little of myself. One must, you know, and
I&#8217;m horribly selfish. It would never do to give my
critics a chance to take a fling at me as a woman
whose marriage is a failure. You can see for yourself,
Miss Durland, how my position would be weakened
if I were a divorcee. Much as I hate to disappoint
you&mdash;it would never do&mdash;really it would not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what are you assuming, Mrs. Trenton?&#8221; demanded
Grace, meeting the gaze of the older woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t discuss that now!&#8221; interrupted Trenton
peremptorily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I suppose you&#8217;d have to confer privately with
Miss Durland before reaching a conclusion. But, I
suggest, Miss Durland, for the sake of your own happiness,
that you avoid, if, indeed, the warning isn&#8217;t too
late, forming any&mdash;what do we call such&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>&#8220;That will do! Stop right there!&#8221; Trenton interrupted.</p>

<p>Grace had swung round from the door, and stood,
her lips parted and with something of the look of an
angry, hurt child in her eyes. It seemed to her that
she was an unwilling eavesdropper, hearing words not
intended for her ears, but without the power to escape.
Then she heard Trenton&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go, Grace,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Craig
is waiting. He will take you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace closed the door after her and paused in the
dim hall. A nightmare numbness had seized her;
and she found herself wondering whether she could
reach the outer door; it seemed remote, unattainable.
She steadied herself against the newel, remembering
an accident in childhood that had left her dazed and
nauseated. Trenton had told her to go; at his wife&#8217;s
bidding he was sending her away and it wasn&#8217;t necessary
for him to dismiss her like that!</p>

<p>She felt herself precipitated into a measureless
oblivion; nothing good or beautiful ever had been or
would be. He had told her to go; that was all; and
like a grieved and heartbroken child she resented being
sent away. In her distress she was incapable of
crediting him with the kindness that had prompted him
to bid her leave.</p>

<p>She was startled by a quick step on the walk outside,
followed by the click of the lock, and the door,
flung open, revealed Miss Reynolds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Grace, I had no idea&mdash;why, child! What&#8217;s
the matter? You&#8217;re as white as a sheet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; said Grace in a whisper, withdrawing
the hand Miss Reynolds had clasped. The door remained
open and the world, a fantastically distorted
world, lay outside. With slow steps she passed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
bewildered friend, saying in the tone of one muttering
in an unhappy dream:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go! He told me to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&mdash;who?&#8221;</p>

<p>The astonished Miss Reynolds, who at first thought
Grace was playing a joke of some kind, watched her
pass slowly down the walk to the gate and enter the
waiting car. She went out upon the steps, uncertain
what to do and caught a last glimpse of Grace&#8217;s face,
her eyes set straight ahead, as the machine bore her
away.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The thought of remaining at home was unbearable,
and after supper Grace telephoned Irene to ask
whether she was free for the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy said something about taking a drive and
I&#8217;m going over to Minnie&#8217;s to meet him. You come
right along. I saw Ward snatch you out of the store.
Pretty cool, I call it! Tommy said he was going back
East at seven, so you&#8217;re a widow once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace left the house with her father, who was
spending all his evenings at Kemp&#8217;s plant. To all
questions at home as to the progress of his motor
Durland replied that he guessed it would be all right.
On the street-car he told Grace he was anxious to see
Trenton; there were difficulties as to the motor that
he wished to discuss with him. He said he had written,
asking an interview as soon as possible, but that
Trenton had not replied. Grace answered that she
knew nothing about him and her heart sank as she
remembered that Trenton was no longer a part of her
life and that in the future he would come and go and
she would never be the wiser.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>It was all over and she faced the task of convincing
herself that her love for him had been a delusion, a
mere episode to be forgotten as quickly as possible.
She left her father at Washington street, cheerily wishing
him good luck, and took a car that ran past
Minnie&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>Irene was alone and, in a new gown of coppergreen
crepe that enhanced the gold in her hair, might have
posed as the spirit of spring. Minnie had remained
down town, she explained, and Tommy was not expected
until nine.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;I know something&#8217;s
doing or you wouldn&#8217;t have called me up from
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace took off her coat, hung it over the back of
a chair and flung herself down on the couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Console me a little, Irene,&mdash;but not too much&mdash;I&#8217;ve
seen Ward for the last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His wife make a row?&#8221; Irene inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he took me to see her and she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He took you to <i>see</i> her! Grace Durland, what <i>are</i>
you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that!&#8221; and Grace, no longer able to restrain
herself, burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene jumped up and thrust a pillow back of Grace&#8217;s
head and sat down beside her. &#8220;Tell me about it if
you want to, but not unless you feel like it, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve simply got to tell you, Irene. Oh&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace Durland, don&#8217;t be silly! You know I&#8217;d <i>die</i>
for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened in patient silence while Grace told with
minute detail and many tears the story of her interview
with Mrs. Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I loved him; I still love him, Irene!&#8221; she moaned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
pitifully when she had finished. &#8220;And it had to end
like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want my opinion,&#8221; said Irene judicially,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll say that Ward Trenton is a perfect nut&mdash;the
final and consummate nut of the whole nut family!
The idea that he would take a girl like you&mdash;and
you&#8217;re a good deal of a kid, my dear&mdash;to call on a
woman like that wife of his, who&#8217;s an experienced
worldly creature, and as much as tell her that he&#8217;s in
love with you! It&#8217;s the limit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Grace, quick to defend the moment
Trenton was attacked, &#8220;he had every reason to believe
she would be decent! She&#8217;d always let him think
that if there was any one else she&#8217;d&mdash;she&#8217;d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d hand him a transfer!&#8221; Irene laughed ironically.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just like poor old Ward! I tell
you men are even as little babes where women are
concerned. There isn&#8217;t a woman on earth who&#8217;d just
calmly sit by and let another woman walk off with
her husband even if she hated him like poison. It&#8217;s
against nature, dearest. I can see how that woman
would make the bluff, all right, but all she wanted
was to see what you looked like and finding you young
and beautiful she tried to make you feel like a counterfeit
nickel. The trouble with Ward is that he&#8217;s so
head over heels in love with you that he&#8217;s lost his
mind. I wonder what happened after you skipped!
I&#8217;ll bet it was some party! But don&#8217;t you believe he&#8217;s
going to give you up&mdash;not Ward! Everything&#8217;s going
to straighten out, honey. His telling you to go doesn&#8217;t
mean a blessed thing! He just wanted to get you out
of the scrap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means the end,&#8221; said Grace with a sigh that lost
itself in a sob.</p>

<p>The bell tinkled and Grace ran away to remove the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
traces of tears from her face. When she reappeared
Kemp greeted her with his usual raillery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had only a word with Ward over the telephone,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;He came out to see his wife and as he borrowed
my limousine I guess he showed her the village
sights. But, of course, you know more about that
bird than I do, Grace. You couldn&#8217;t scare me up a
drink, could you, Irene? Minnie&#8217;s got some stuff of
mine concealed here somewhere. Just a spoonful&mdash;no?
Grace, this girl is a cruel tyrant. She positively
refuses to let me die a drunkard&#8217;s happy death.&#8221;</p>

<p>He evidently wasn&#8217;t aware that Grace had seen
Trenton and Irene carefully kept the talk in safe
channels. He had brought his roadster, not knowing
that he was to find Grace at Minnie&#8217;s, but he insisted
that the car carried three comfortably and he wouldn&#8217;t
consider leaving her behind.</p>

<p>It was the same car in which Trenton had driven her
into town after the night they spent together at The
Shack. In spite of her attempts to forget, thoughts of
him filled her mind like an implacable host of soldiery....</p>

<p>After a plunge into the country they swung back to
town along the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Kemp suddenly. &#8220;There&#8217;s
my little factory over there in the moonlight. Have
you ever seen it, Grace? We&#8217;ll just dash in for a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if father&#8217;s still there?&#8221; said Grace as
they drove into the lighted yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon find out. That&#8217;s his workshop yonder
where you see the bluish lights. I see O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s light
on in the main office. That fellow works too hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing somebody works around this
place,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;The world knows you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not as bad as that,&#8221; Kemp retorted, and
led the way down a long aisle of one of the steel and
glass units of the big plant. The moon diffused its
mild radiance through the glass roof, as though mocking
with a superior mystery the silent inert machinery.</p>

<p>The sound of voices became audible in a room partitioned
off in one corner. The door was ajar and two
men in overalls and jumpers were pondering a motor
set up on a testing block.</p>

<p>The trio remained outside, watching the two intent,
rapt figures. One Grace had recognized as her father;
the other, she realized bewilderedly, was Ward Trenton.
Trenton, unconscious that he was watched,
raised his hand and Durland turned a switch. The
hum of a motor filled the room; and Durland turned
slowly from the motor to glance at Trenton. Trenton
signalled to shut off the power and dropped upon his
knees, peering into the machine. Durland took up a
sheet of paper and from it answered the questions
which Trenton shot at him in rapid succession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have the power again,&#8221; said Trenton. He
rose, bent his ear to study the sound, turned to Durland
and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see what they&#8217;re up to,&#8221; said Kemp and
shouted Trenton&#8217;s name. Grace drew back as the two
men turned toward them, but Irene seized her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare run away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenton came toward them snatching off his blue
mechanic&#8217;s cap. There was a smudge across his face
and his hands were black from contact with the machinery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t really lie to you, Tommy: I meant to leave
tonight but remembered that Mr. Durland wanted to
see me, so here I am.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>They followed him to the testing block where Durland
had remained, too engrossed to heed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came just when you did,&#8221; said Trenton
addressing all of them but looking at Grace. &#8220;Mr.
Durland will be ready to begin the final tests tomorrow.
I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re going to be successful. I
want you to be here, Tommy, and see the thing
through. Just look at this!&#8221;</p>

<p>He deftly lifted out a part of the motor for Kemp&#8217;s
inspection, restored it and then bent over the bench,
rapidly scribbling notes on the back of a blue print.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulations are now in order, I suppose,&#8221; said
Kemp. He turned and shook hands with Durland, who
was regarding the motor with a puzzled look on his
face. Trenton said he would remain a while longer&mdash;he
might stay all night, he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too important to leave, so I&#8217;ve changed all
my plans and will be here two or three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When this bird works, he works,&#8221; said Kemp,
laying his hand affectionately on Trenton&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>Trenton followed them out, keeping close to Grace.
When they were out of ear shot of her father&mdash;Durland
apparently hadn&#8217;t noticed that Grace was in the
room&mdash;Trenton said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I called you at home this evening and found you&#8217;d
gone out. I want to see you; I <i>must</i> see you,&#8221; he
said pleadingly.</p>

<p>Kemp had reached the main shop and was explaining
to Irene some of the points of the motor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kemp!&#8221; Trenton called. &#8220;What are you doing
tomorrow night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing; I&#8217;m ready for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Grace and I would like to have dinner with
you at The Shack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A grand idea! Only remember&mdash;none of this prohibition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
stuff you pulled on me Christmas. I cannot
dine without my wine!&#8221; he chanted.</p>

<p>When they reached the yard Kemp and Irene were
waiting by the car. Trenton caught Grace&#8217;s hand and
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, I love you! I shall always love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;&#8221; she began. &#8220;Oh this isn&#8217;t kind! I
thought you had gone&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Grace,&#8221; cried Kemp. &#8220;See you tomorrow,
Ward. Good-night and good luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>To Grace, on the homeward drive, peace seemed an
unattainable thing. She had firmly resolved never to
see Trenton again; but she had not only seen him
but the sight of him had deepened the hunger in her
heart. She was without the will to deny him the
meeting for which he had asked. It was sweet to
think that he had remained if only to assist her father
when he had definitely said that he was leaving that
night. Yes; there was kindness in this; and even
though he had sent her away from Miss Reynolds&#8217;s
and wounded her deeply in his manner of doing it,
she knew that it was always his wish to be kind and
that no power could keep her from seeing him again,
if only for a last good-bye.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> she dressed the next morning Grace hummed and
whistled, happy in the consciousness that before the
day ended she would see Trenton again. The romantic
strain in her warmed and quickened at the thought.
Even if they were to part for all time and she should
go through life with his love only a memory, it would
be a memory precious and ineffaceable, that would
sweeten and brighten all her years.</p>

<p>In his workman&#8217;s garb, as she had seen him at
Kemp&#8217;s, she idealized him anew. If it had been his
fate to remain a laborer, his skill would have set him
apart from his fellows. He could never have been
other than a man of mark. It was a compensation
for anything she might miss in her life to have known
the love of such a man. She was impatient with herself
and sought the lowest depths of self-abasement
for having doubted him. She should never again
question his sincerity or his wisdom, but would abide
by his decision in all things.</p>

<p>When she reached the dining room her father was
already gone, and her mother seemed troubled about
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was excited and nervous when he came home
last night,&#8221; said Mrs. Durland. &#8220;He hardly slept and
he left an hour ago saying he&#8217;d get a cup of coffee
on his way through town. I&#8217;m afraid things haven&#8217;t
been going right with him. It would be a terrible
blow if the motor didn&#8217;t turn out as he expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just keep hoping, mother; that&#8217;s the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
way,&#8221; Grace replied cheerily. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t be
wasting time on it at Kemp&#8217;s if there wasn&#8217;t something
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right there,&#8221; interposed Ethel.
&#8220;Kemp has the reputation of being a cold-blooded
proposition. And I suppose the great Trenton values
his own reputation too much to recommend anything
that hasn&#8217;t got money in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor foolish men <i>will</i> persist in going into business
to make money, not for fun,&#8221; Grace replied. &#8220;I
suppose Gregg and Burley don&#8217;t sell insurance just as
a matter of philanthropy. Mr. Trenton would soon
be out of work if he didn&#8217;t have the confidence of
the people who hire him. I wouldn&#8217;t be so bitter if I
were you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you rolling up in an automobile last night,&#8221;
Ethel persisted. &#8220;You seem to be getting the benefit
of somebody&#8217;s money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethel!&#8221; cried her mother despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her rave,&#8221; replied Grace calmly. &#8220;When Mr.
Burley drives Ethel home from the office it&#8217;s an act
of Christian kindness, but if I get a lift it&#8217;s a sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Burley,&#8221; began Ethel, breathing heavily, &#8220;Mr.
Burley is the very soul of honor! He wanted to talk
to me about some of the work in our Sunday school
and hadn&#8217;t time to discuss it in the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think for a minute I have any objection!
If he was just opening up a little flirtation it would be
all right with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you?&#8221; cried Ethel, beginning to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Grace,&#8221; began Mrs. Durland, pausing on
her way to the kitchen with the coffee pot.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, mother,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;I resent just a
little bit having Ethel grab all the virtue in the family.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not ashamed to tell who brings me home anyhow,&#8221;
Ethel flung at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither, for that matter, am I! It was Mr.
Thomas Ripley Kemp who brought me home last
night. He&#8217;d taken Irene and me for a drive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that <i>was</i> it! I thought I recognized the car.
That Kemp! I suppose he&#8217;s getting tired of Irene
and is looking for another girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dearie, he hasn&#8217;t said anything about it,&#8221;
Grace replied. &#8220;But you never can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls! This must stop right here! We can&#8217;t
have the day beginning with a wrangle. You both
ought to be ashamed of yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through, mother,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t start
the row. I&#8217;ve reached a place where Ethel doesn&#8217;t
really worry me any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you were always a tease and Ethel is sensitive.
I do wish you&#8217;d both exercise a little restraint.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace found a brief note in the society column of
the morning paper recording Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s departure,
and an editorial ridiculing her opinions.
Elsewhere there were interviews with a dozen prominent
men and women on Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s lecture,
all expressing disapproval of her ideas. A leading
Socialist disavowed any sympathy with Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s
programme and denounced her &#8220;Clues to a New
Social Order&#8221; as a mere rehash of other books. He
characterized her as a woman of wealth who was
merely seeking notoriety by parading herself as a
revolutionist and who would be sure to resist, with the
innate selfishness and greed of her class, any interference
with her personal comfort and ease.</p>

<p>Grace carried the newspaper with her to the trolley
and on the way down town reread these criticisms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
Mrs. Trenton with keenest satisfaction. Mrs. Trenton
was not a great woman animated by a passion of humanity
but narrow, selfish and cruel. She thought
again of the encounter at Miss Reynolds&#8217;s with renewed
sympathy for Trenton. After all he had met
the difficult situation in the only way possible. He
had said once that he didn&#8217;t understand his wife and
Grace consoled herself with the reflection that probably
no one could understand her, least of all, her
husband.</p>

<p>In the course of the day Grace learned from Irene
that Kemp, who was on the entertainment committee
for a large national convention, had decided to ask
several friends among the delegates to The Shack.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be a shocker, like some of Tommy&#8217;s
parties, only a little personal attention for a few of
the old comrades,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;You and Ward can
see as little of the rest of the bunch as you please.
Tommy has promised me solemnly to let booze alone.
I suppose his wife will never know how hard I&#8217;ve
worked to keep him straight! Ridiculous, isn&#8217;t it?
Before that woman came back from California Tommy
hadn&#8217;t touched a drop for a month, and he&#8217;s been
doing wonderfully ever since. The good lady was so
pleased with his appearance and conduct that she beat
it for New York last night to buy clothes and by the
time she gets back I&#8217;ll be ready to release my mortgage
on Tommy for good and all. I&#8217;ve broken the news
to him gently and he&#8217;s been awfully nice about it.
This is really my last appearance with Tommy&mdash;it&#8217;s
understood on both sides. I wouldn&#8217;t go at all if it
were not for you and Ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace envied Irene the ease with which she met
situations. Irene&#8217;s cynicism, she had decided, was
only on the surface; she wished she could be sure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
she herself possessed the sound substratum of character
that Irene was revealing. Irene had sinned grievously
against the laws of God and man; but after disdaining
those influences that seek to safeguard society,
and carrying her head high, with a certain serene impudence
in her wrong-doing, she now appeared to be on
good terms with her soul. It was a strange thing that
this could be&mdash;one of the most curious and baffling of
all Grace&#8217;s recent experiences. Face to face with
the problem of her future relations with Trenton,
Grace was finding in Irene something akin to a moral
tonic. Irene, by a code of her own, did somehow manage
to cling fast to things reckoned fine and noble.
Irene, in spite of herself, had the soul of a virtuous
woman.</p>

<p>It was to be a party of ten, Grace learned after
Irene had conferred with Kemp by telephone at the
lunch hour. For the edification of the three strange
men Irene had provided three other girls who had,
as Irene said, some class and knew how to amuse
tired business men without becoming vulgar. Grace
knew these young women&mdash;they were variously employed
down town&mdash;but she would never have thought
of asking them to &#8220;go on a party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one of these girls makes less than two thousand
a year,&#8221; Irene announced loftily. &#8220;God preserve
me from cheap stuff! It makes me sick, Grace, to
see these poor little fools who run around the streets,
all dolled up with enough paint on their faces to cover
the state house and not enough brains in their heads
to make a croquette for a sick mosquito. If it hadn&#8217;t
been for all this silly rot about emancipating women
they&#8217;d be at home cooking and helping mamma with
the wash. As it is they draw twelve a week and spend
it all on clothes to advertise their sex. Do you know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
Grace, I sometimes shudder for the future of the human
race!&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Jerry had been reinforced by a colored cateress and
the country supper produced at The Shack proved to
be a sumptuous dinner. Kemp had brought from his
well-stocked cave on the farm the ingredients for a
certain cocktail, known by his name throughout the
corn-belt. The &#8220;Tommy Kemp&#8221; was immediately pronounced
to be the last word in cocktails,&mdash;a concoction
which, one of the visitors declared, completely annulled
and set aside the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States as an insolent assault
upon the personal liberty and the palate of man.
Kemp was in the gayest spirits; the party was wholly
to his taste. The men he entertained were conspicuously
successful, and leaders in the business and
social life of their several cities. Irene had confided
to Grace that there were at least ten millions of good
money represented in the party.</p>

<p>The cocktails were served in the living room to the
accompaniment of much lively chatter. Grace found
herself observing with interest the readiness with
which the young women who were strangers to The
Shack&#8217;s hospitality entered into the spirit of the occasion
and met on terms of familiar good fellowship the
men they hadn&#8217;t seen before. It helped her to forget
her disappointment at the size of the party to speculate
about the men and the curious phase of human
nature that made it possible for gentlemen whose
names were well known throughout America, who
looked as though they might pass the plate in church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
every Sunday, to enter joyfully into the pleasures of
such a function. Irene had made no mistake in her
choice of girls; they were handsome; they looked well
in their summer frocks; they were lively and responsive;
they were pastmistresses of the gentle art of
kidding. There was no question but that the visiting
gentlemen of wealth and social position enjoyed being
kidded, and the fact that some of them had daughters
at home much older than the girls who did the kidding
in no wise mitigated their joy.</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen evidently preferred Grace to
the girl who had been assigned to him. Under the inspiration
of his cocktail he told Grace that he had long
wished to meet her; that now they had met he was
resolved that they should never part again. Grace
summoned all her powers of flirtation and encouraged
him, realizing that to snub him would be to prove
herself a poor sport; and she had heard enough of
parties from Irene to know that a girl must not when
&#8220;on a party&#8221; give cause for any suspicion that she is
of the melancholy tribe of kill-joys. She took a sip
of the &#8220;Tommy Kemp&#8221; and handed it to the gentleman
who was so beguiled by her charms, who drained
the glass, murmuring ecstatically:</p>

<p>&#8220;To the most beautiful girl in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let grandpa worry you,&#8221; whispered Irene.
&#8220;Just tease him a little and he&#8217;ll think he&#8217;s having the
time of his life. We&#8217;re not drinking&mdash;you and I.
This is positively my last party! I&#8217;m going to have
my hands full keeping Tommy sober.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenton was talking during the cocktailing period
to one of the most attractive of the girls, and when
Grace glanced at him he smiled and held up his unemptied
glass and put it back on the tray. He was
not drinking, not even the single cocktail he usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
permitted himself. There was serious business before
them; both must keep their heads clear for it.</p>

<p>The dinner seemed endlessly long. Now and then
Grace felt the reassuring pressure of Trenton&#8217;s hand,
but the gentleman on the other side of her, under the
mellowing influence of champagne piled upon the
&#8220;Tommy Kemps&#8221; he had imbibed, was making violent
love to her; and his elaborate tributes of adoration
could not be wholly ignored. Seeing that Trenton was
talking little, Kemp, still sober, thanks to Irene&#8217;s
watchfulness, addressed him directly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got news for you, Ward. At five o&#8217;clock this
afternoon I closed a deal for Cummings&#8217;s plant.
Bought Isaac Cummings&#8217;s controlling interest and for
better or worse the darned thing&#8217;s mine. Please,
everybody, drink to good luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s all about, but we&#8217;re for
you, Tommy,&#8221; cried one of the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you said you&#8217;d never do it, Tommy,&#8221;
said Trenton, smiling at his friend and lifting his
champagne glass, reversed as it had stood on the
table.</p>

<p>Kemp protested that this was bad luck and ordered
Jerry to serve no more food until every one had drunk
to the success of the merger. This brought them all
to their feet with lifted glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, king, live forever!&#8221; cried Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something like it,&#8221; said Kemp. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mention the matter just to advertise my business. I
wanted you to know, Grace, that it gave me a special
satisfaction on your account to see Cummings pass
out. It was a downright low trick he played on your
father. Things do sort o&#8217; even up in this world and
this struck quick and hard. When Cummings threw
your father out the business was ripe for bankruptcy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
Don&#8217;t let Ward scold me. He advised me against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I advised you against taking on new responsibilities,&#8221;
Trenton replied. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got enough on your
hands now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m a sick man,&#8221; said Kemp. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
going to see you all under the sod. I like this world
and I&#8217;m going to live a hundred years. Jerry, fill &#8217;em
up!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was more food than any one needed or wanted
and when Jerry began serving dessert Trenton suggested
to Grace that they leave the table. Their leaving
evoked loud protests. Irene was now furiously
angry at Kemp, who had been unable to resist the lure
of the champagne, a vintage without duplicate in all
America, he declared.</p>

<p>The gentleman at Grace&#8217;s left, reduced to a maudlin
state by his host&#8217;s generous distribution of wine, loudly
importuned her not to go. Kemp announced his purpose
to make a speech and was trying to get upon his
feet when Irene pulled him down. One of the visitors
began to sing and seized a candle from the table with
which to beat time. He was bawling, &#8220;He&#8217;s a jolly
good fellow,&#8221; as Grace and Trenton effected their
escape.</p>

<p>They breathed deep of the clean country air when
they reached the long veranda at the side of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Tommy; I suppose there&#8217;s no way of stopping
him,&#8221; remarked Trenton.</p>

<p>Both were aware of a new restraint the moment they
were alone. The still night was sweet with spring and
the earth seemed subdued by the mystery of green
things growing.</p>

<p>Grace walked the length of the veranda, then back
to the steps, Trenton beside her. He was still troubled
by a sense of responsibility for Kemp. The discordant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
noises from the dining room followed them
and they debated whether they should try to break up
the party but decided against it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get away from the racket,&#8221; said Trenton.
&#8220;When I suggested coming out for supper it didn&#8217;t
occur to me that Tommy would be pulling off a bacchanalian
feast. Tommy&#8217;s incorrigible&mdash;dear old
Tommy! But&mdash;we must talk. Shall we go up yonder
where we can look out over the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stars and an old moon that stared blandly
across the heavens made the path easily discernible.
As they loitered along he spoke of Kemp&#8217;s purchase of
the Cummings concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did advise Tommy against it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because
of the additional burdens he&#8217;ll have to carry. But it&#8217;s
a good business stroke. He&#8217;s wiped out an old competitor
and with your father&#8217;s improvements on Cummings&#8217;s
motor Tommy&#8217;s going to be greatly strengthened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been afraid,&#8221; said Grace, &#8220;that father&#8217;s ideas
wouldn&#8217;t prove practical. He&#8217;s seemed terribly worried
lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the usual perplexities of a genius who&#8217;s worn
out from long application! He can breathe easy now.
The motor&#8217;s going to be a wonder. I was with your
father all day and he&#8217;s attained every excellence he
claimed. You have every reason to be proud of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all your kindness,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not a bit of it! There&#8217;s no sentiment about
mechanics. You&#8217;ve either got it or you haven&#8217;t. And
your father is sound on the fundamentals where most
inventors are weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat down on a rustic bench on the bluff above
the river and he threw his overcoat across her knees.
Above them towered a sycamore; below they heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
the murmur and ripple of running water. He put his
arm about her, drew her close and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it were all true, as we can imagine it to
be in this quiet place, that we&#8217;re absolutely alone in
the world&mdash;just ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t true; we&#8217;ve just run away from the
world for a little while,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m glad for
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his and gently stroked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you understood why I didn&#8217;t go yesterday
as I&#8217;d intended. I couldn&#8217;t leave without explaining.
I couldn&#8217;t have you think that I took you to Miss
Reynolds&#8217;s just to make you uncomfortable. It was
my mistake and a stupid blunder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the mistake was mine,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;I
realized afterwards that my first feeling was right,
that it was foolish to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was honest about it. Mrs. Trenton had led me
to think that she wouldn&#8217;t resent meeting any woman
who promised to give me the love and companionship
it wasn&#8217;t in her power to give me. I took her at her
word. You understand that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have known, Ward, and so should I,
that no woman would ever have anything but hatred
for another woman her husband falls in love with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what I&#8217;ve given you she never had! I want
you to believe me when I say that I was really deceived
by what I took to be her wholly friendly attitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make the least difference now, Ward.
I know you wouldn&#8217;t have taken me to see her if you&#8217;d
known what would happen. I&#8217;ll never have any but
the kindest thoughts of you. Please believe that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved a little away from him and leaned back,
her hands relaxed in her lap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s all been a mistake&mdash;everything&mdash;from the beginning,&#8221;
she went on in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My loving you hasn&#8217;t been a mistake,&#8221; he said
earnestly. &#8220;Nothing has changed that or can ever
change it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You merely think that. If you didn&#8217;t see me for
a while you&#8217;d forget me,&#8221; she said, following unconsciously
the ritual of unhappy lovers in all times.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he gently protested. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t the way of
it. You don&#8217;t really think that. Please say that you
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone of pleading caused her to turn to him and
fling her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I love you so! I love you so!&#8221; she sobbed.</p>

<p>His face was wet with her tears. He took her again
into his arms, turning her face that he might kiss the
tears away. Her whole body shook with her convulsive
sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest little girl! Poor, dear little child!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the branches above a bird fluttered and cheeped
as though startled in its dreaming. She freed herself,
sought her handkerchief to dry her eyes. With the
impotence of man before a woman&#8217;s grief he sought to
brush back a wisp of hair that had fallen across her
cheek and his hand trembled. Her face seemed to
hover in the star dusk; he saw the quiver of her lashes,
the parted lips, felt for an instant the throbbing pulse
in her throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew the end would come,&#8221; she said, with a deep
sigh, &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know it would be like this. It&#8217;s
been so dear, so wonderful! I thought it would go on
forever!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her gaze was upon the dark uneven line of the
trees across the river where they brushed the stars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t the end, dear! A love like ours can&#8217;t
die. It belongs to the things of all time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Ward,&#8221; she said impatiently, drawing her
cloak more tightly about her shoulders. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not
deceive ourselves any more. You know we can&#8217;t go
on,&#8221; she continued, as one who has reasoned through
a thing and reached an irrefutable conclusion. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all been like a dream; but dreams don&#8217;t last. And
this should never have begun!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You break my heart when you say things like
that! As we&#8217;ve said so many times&mdash;it all had to be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were fools to think it could last,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But it was more my fault than yours. And you&#8217;ve
been dear and kind&mdash;Oh, so beautifully kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve trusted me; you&#8217;ve proved that! You&#8217;ve
never doubted&mdash;you don&#8217;t doubt now that I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it does no good to talk&mdash;let&#8217;s just be quiet&mdash;I
do love you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must talk,&#8221; he replied stubbornly. &#8220;You are the
dearest thing in the world to me. I couldn&#8217;t foresee
what happened. It&#8217;s only right you should know
what occurred after you left Miss Reynolds&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Please no! I have no right to know; and it
can make no difference. I knew it was all over when
I left the house, but I did want to see you once
more&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was trying to be brave but the words faltered
and died.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t discuss you, try to explain you in any way.
I only expressed my indignation at the wholly unnecessary
manner in which Mrs. Trenton treated you, after
encouraging me to believe that you would be treated
with every courtesy. I suppose it was jealousy that
prompted her to speak to you as she did. Miss Reynolds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
came in at once. You must have met her&mdash;and
I took leave after I&#8217;d tried to cover up the fact that
something disagreeable had happened. That was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was enough. There wasn&#8217;t a thing you could
say. Mrs. Trenton had every right on her side. I
hope you&#8217;ll go back to her and tell her that any feeling
you had for me was just a mistake; make light of the
whole thing. Of course she loves you. If she didn&#8217;t
she wouldn&#8217;t be jealous. There&#8217;s nothing for you to
do now but to make your peace with her. Don&#8217;t trouble
about me. I don&#8217;t want to stand in the way of
your happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace,&#8221; he said, patient in spite of her strained
petulant tone, &#8220;there&#8217;s no question of love about it.
We know we love each other; but we&#8217;ve got to be
sane about this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk about it, Ward! You know as well
as I do that we&#8217;ve reached the end. And please, dear,
don&#8217;t make it harder for me by pretending it isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m
not a child, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to pretend anything, Grace, least
of all we&#8217;re not going to pretend that everything&#8217;s
over when we know we couldn&#8217;t forget if we wanted
to. But we&#8217;ve got to have a care for a little while at
least, now that Mrs. Trenton knows just enough to
arouse her suspicions. I feel my responsibility about
you very seriously. Please&mdash;won&#8217;t you believe me
when I say that it&#8217;s of you I&#8217;m thinking first? We
might go on seeing each other as we have been, or I
might take you away with me&mdash;I&#8217;ve thought of that;
but I&#8217;ve thought too of the danger. I can&#8217;t promise
you that Mrs. Trenton wouldn&#8217;t spy upon us,&mdash;do
something that would drag you into the newspapers,
make an ugly mess. Her prominence would make attractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
newspaper material of you and me, too. I
love you too dearly to take any chances. Don&#8217;t you
understand? Isn&#8217;t it better&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please stop, Ward! Don&#8217;t talk to me as
though I were a child! It all comes to the same thing,
that we mustn&#8217;t see each other any more. I knew it
when I left Miss Reynolds&#8217;s yesterday. It would
have been better if we hadn&#8217;t come out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be forever,&#8221; he doggedly persisted. &#8220;In
the end I&#8217;m going to have you. I want you to remember
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward, how perfectly foolish of you to talk that
way! If we were to go on as we have been we
wouldn&#8217;t be happy. Let&#8217;s just acknowledge that this
is the last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be that way!
You&#8217;ve lost your courage and I can&#8217;t blame you for
seeing things black. If I had only myself to consider
I&#8217;d run away with you tonight; but that would be a
despicable thing for me to do. I love you too much
for that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The protestation of his love brought her no ease.
She was half angered by his stubborn refusal to face
the truth, and his professed belief that sometime in
some way they were to be reunited. He was trying
to see the light of hope ahead where all was dark to
her.</p>

<p>It was strange to be sitting there beside him, thinking
already of their love with all its intimacies, that
had seemed to bind them together forever, as something
that had been swept into a past from which, in
a little while, memory would cease to recall it. This
was love! This was the thing that had been
written of and sung of in all the ages; and it was a
lure contrived only to bruise and break and destroy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>She touched the lowest depths of despair, snatched
away her hand when he tried to possess it; thought of
him for an instant with repulsion. The wistful tenderness
of the night, the monotonous ripple of water beneath,
the very tranquillity of the stars seemed to
mock and taunt her.</p>

<p>He waited patiently, silent, impassive, as though he
knew what she was thinking and knew, too, that such
thoughts were inevitable and must run their course.</p>

<p>The silence fell upon her like a soothing hand. The
tumultuous rush of her thoughts ceased; she was
amazed at the serenity with which suddenly she
viewed the situation.</p>

<p>He was finer than she, wiser, more far seeing.
Something in his figure, in his dimly etched profile in
the faint starlight touched her profoundly. It was
selfish of her to forget that he too suffered. He was a
man she had given herself to without reservation, and
with all the honesty and fervor of her young heart, and
to think harshly of him was to acknowledge herself a
shameless wanton, no better than a girl on the street.
She could not think ill of him without debasing herself.
And she did love him; she had loved him from
the first, and it was not the way of love to wound.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had been sincere in saying that he
wished to protect her&mdash;this was like him, and it was
cruel of her to question his love, to fail to help him
when he sought with all kindness and consideration
to find some hope in the future. They must part and
it might be for the last time, but she would not send
him away feeling that she had not appreciated all
that his love had been and would continue to be to her.
Without him, without some knowledge of his whereabouts
and activities and the assurance of his well-being,
life would be unbearable. She was all tenderness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
all solicitude, wholly self-forgetful, as she softly
uttered his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward!&#8221; her arms found their way round his shoulders.
&#8220;I&#8217;m selfish,&mdash;I was thinking that you taught
me to love you only to thrust me away. But I know
better, dear. You are dearer to me than anything in
all the world&mdash;dearer than my life even and I know
you mean to be kind. I know you want to do the
right thing for both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; yes!&#8221; he whispered eagerly and kissed her
gently on lips and eyes. &#8220;If we truly love each other
there will be some way. It was not of our ordering&mdash;any
of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we must believe that, dear! There can never
be any man for me but you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And no woman for me but you!&#8221;</p>

<p>They clung to each other, silent, fearing to utter
even the reassuring and consoling words that formed
on their lips. Beyond the river a train passed swiftly
with a long blast of the locomotive.</p>

<p>They drew apart, listening till the whistle&#8217;s last echo
and the rumble of cars died away. Trenton sighed
deeply. The disturbance had been an unwelcome reminder
of the energies of the world of men hidden by
the night. Grace was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been so dear to have this hour! But, we
mustn&#8217;t meet again. Please don&#8217;t ask me to see you&mdash;ever&mdash;not
in any way. We&#8217;ll both be happier if what
we say tonight is final. We can&#8217;t just begin over again
and be friends. That would mean forgetfulness&mdash;and
we can&#8217;t forget. Please don&#8217;t write me. I&#8217;m going to be
all right. I&#8217;ll be happy just thinking of you. We&#8217;re
both brave and strong and knowing that will help&mdash;won&#8217;t
it, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew that at the moment at least she was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
braver and stronger. He had nothing to add to what
she had said. She rose and took his face in her hands
and kissed him gently, passionlessly; passed her hands
across his eyes, spoke his name softly. He neither
spoke nor responded to her caresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>She touched his arm lightly and started down the
path. He waited a moment before following.</p>

<p>She talked in a cheery tone of irrelevant things,
laughed merrily when she lost the path; and so they
came back to the garden where the lights of the house
confronted them. At the veranda steps he caught her
suddenly in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be like this! I&#8217;m not going to give you up!
Tell me you understand that it&#8217;s only for a little
while&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to talk about it any more&mdash;&#8221;
she said without a quaver&mdash;with even a little ring of
confidence in her voice. But she suffered his kiss,
yielded for a moment to his embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll love you always, always, always!&#8221; she said
slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll love you till I die!&#8221; he replied. They stood
with hands clasped for an instant, then she turned
and ran into the house.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>They had been gone more than an hour and the
other members of the party stared at them as though
they were intruders. Two of the men, not too befuddled
by their potations to remember that they were
leaving town by a midnight train, were trying to convince
Kemp that it was time to go. Tommy was explaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
elaborately that there were plenty of trains;
that if there was anything the city was proud of it
was the frequency with which trains departed for all
points of the compass.</p>

<p>Irene in her disgust with Kemp for exceeding the
limits she had fixed for his indulgence in the prized
champagne had retired to the kitchen to talk to Jerry.
Hearing Trenton&#8217;s voice expostulating with Tommy
she appeared, and announced that she was going
home. One of the girls, overcome by champagne had
retired and Irene went upstairs to see what could
be done to restore her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Jerry for some black coffee, Grace, that will
fix her,&#8221; said Irene.</p>

<p>She confided to Grace her indignation at the young
woman for not behaving herself; she was disappointed
in her. A girl, she declared, shouldn&#8217;t go on a party
if she hadn&#8217;t any more sense than to get drunk. However,
she ministered to the young woman effectively
and kindly.</p>

<p>Trenton got the three visiting gentlemen and the
young women who had accompanied them into a machine
and dispatched them to town and resumed his
efforts to persuade Kemp to go home. Kemp wished
to discuss with Trenton his business plans for the future.
He wanted Trenton to promise to move to Indianapolis
immediately to assist him in the management
of his plant. Finding Trenton unwilling to commit himself
Kemp fixed his attention upon Irene. He became
tearful as he talked of Irene. She was the most beautiful
girl in the world, and she had brightened his life; he
would always be grateful to her. And now that she
had grown tired of what he called their little arrangement,
he wanted her to be happy. He wished Trenton
and Grace to bear witness that he bore no hard
feeling but wished her well. If at any time Irene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
needed help of any kind it would break his heart if
she didn&#8217;t appeal to him.</p>

<p>Finding that the others were impatient at the delay
these deliverances were causing he assumed an injured
air and bade them take him home. They didn&#8217;t love
him; nobody loved him. When finally they got him
out to the big touring car he insisted that he would do
the driving and this called for a long argument before
he was dissuaded. He refused to enter the car at all
until the others were settled in the back seat. He
guessed he knew the demands of hospitality! Craig
roused his ire by attempting to help him in and he
waited till the chauffeur was seated and ready to start
before he would move. Then he adjusted one of the
disappearing seats, got in and began an ironical lecture
on the instability of friendship. Some of his remarks
were amusing and they encouraged him to go
on feeling that so long as they manifested interest he
would not revive the question of driving to the various
points he had proposed as attractive places to run for
breakfast. He announced suddenly that he had always
wanted to visit the Tippecanoe Battle Ground
and demanded an opinion from Craig as to how long
it would take to drive there. He was irritated because
the chauffeur professed not to know the route; he declared
that he would get even with Craig for lying to
him.</p>

<p>He became quiet presently and Trenton tried to interest
him in a description of a mechanical stoker that
had lately been put on the market.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mus&#8217; look into it,&#8221; said Kemp. &#8220;Awfu&#8217; nice of
you to tell me &#8217;bout it, Ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then before they knew what he was about he
clutched the back of the front seat and threw one leg
over. He swayed toward the driver and to steady
himself grabbed the wheel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>Craig, believing Kemp wholly interested in Trenton&#8217;s
talk, was caught off guard. The car, which had
been running swiftly over the smooth road, swerved
sharply and plunged into the deep drainage ditch that
paralleled the road. As the radiator struck the further
side of the ditch Kemp was thrown forward and his
head crashed against the windshield with terrific force.</p>

<p>The three passengers on the back seat were pitched
violently to the floor. Craig had shut off the motor
instantly and jumped out, and when Trenton joined
him in the road he was tearing off the curtains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your flash, Craig,&#8221; Trenton said. But without
waiting for the light he thrust in his arms and
lifted Kemp out. Irene and Grace had crawled out
and stood in the road clinging to each other and hysterically
demanding to know what had happened to
Tommy.</p>

<p>Craig jerked out the seat cushions and Trenton
laid Kemp upon them. The flashlight showed
Kemp&#8217;s face deathly white and smeared with blood.
Trenton was on his knees, his head against the stricken
man&#8217;s heart. He looked up with a startled awed look
and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; he said under his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ward! Not <i>that</i>!&#8221; faltered Irene, &#8220;Not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;No! We must keep our heads! Craig!
What&#8217;s the quickest way of getting help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward&mdash;Oh, Tommy, Tommy!&#8221; cried Irene, dropping
on her knees and taking Kemp&#8217;s head in her
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Irene&mdash;don&#8217;t!&#8221; moaned Grace helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a house a quarter of a mile ahead where
I can telephone,&#8221; Craig said. &#8220;I know the farmer;
you can rely on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute,&#8221; said Trenton, looking at his watch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
&#8220;There are things to consider. We&#8217;ve got to think
of Tommy first of all. Craig, I can count on you&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly, sir. I&#8217;m afraid it was my fault;
I ought to have been watching. But I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were no more to blame than I was. We can&#8217;t
discuss that now. We&#8217;ve got to take care of this in a
way that will protect Tommy, and you girls mustn&#8217;t
figure in it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We understand all that; we&#8217;ll do anything you
say, Ward,&#8221; sobbed Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to think of some one we can trust to
help,&#8221; said Trenton. &#8220;There will be many things to
do immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Irene turning to Grace, &#8220;whether
we could reach John Moore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one better!&#8221; Grace eagerly assented.
&#8220;We could telephone him at his boarding house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenton asked a few questions about Moore and began
instructing Craig as to the persons he was to call
by telephone; first a physician, who was also an intimate
friend of the Kemps and two of Kemp&#8217;s neighbors,
well known to Trenton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kemp and I had been to The Shack for dinner&mdash;alone&mdash;Jerry
and the cateress must be taken care of as
to that. Tommy was driving home. Something went
wrong with the car and it ran off into the ditch. How
about that, Craig?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say, Mr. Trenton, that Mr. Kemp was
driving. The driver in such accidents is seldom hurt.
We&#8217;d better say the car simply struck a stone and
swerved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Craig hurriedly suggested possible explanations of
a deflection that would ditch a car at this point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s better,&#8221; Trenton agreed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>&#8220;If the young ladies could go into town on an interurban
car that would help,&#8221; said Craig. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a
little way to a stop on the crossroad back yonder.
There&#8217;ll be a car passing at half-past twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>These matters hastily determined, Craig hurried
away, the quick patter of his feet on the macadam
suggesting the flight of a malevolent fate that had
struck its blow and was flying from the scene.</p>

<p>Tommy Kemp was dead. There was no question
but that he had died instantly, either from the violent
blow on the head or from a failure of the heart due
to the shock of his precipitation against the windshield.</p>

<p>No cars had passed since the accident, but as they
were on a highway Trenton urged Irene and Grace to
go at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be seen here. It&#8217;s horrible enough
without having you mixed up in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene bent down and touched the quiet face, murmuring:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cruel to leave him like this! Poor boy! Poor
dear Tommy!&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Grace and Irene had worn hats on the tragic adventure
and their long dark cloaks covered their party
dresses so that their entrance into the interurban car
awakened little interest in the half-dozen dozing passengers.
Fortunately Grace had her purse and paid
the fares. The swift rush of the car exerted a quieting
effect upon them. Irene had wrenched her shoulder
when the machine leaped into the ditch, but Grace had
escaped with only a few scratches. They conferred in
low tones, still dazed by their close contact with death.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>&#8220;I ought to have insisted on going home earlier.
But I did the best I could. Tommy wouldn&#8217;t budge.
Tell me that I did the best I could!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you did! We should never have gone&mdash;any
of us!&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;I&#8217;m as much to blame as any
one. But Tommy would have gone anyhow, you know
he would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget
him as he stood there beside Tommy as we left. Those
men loved each other; and Tommy was <i>good</i>, Grace.
I&#8217;m glad I had it out with him&mdash;about quitting I mean.
He was sober then; perfectly all right. It was just
before you and Ward came back that he began drinking
crazily. When I told him I thought it was all
wrong and that I wanted to quit he talked to me in the
finest way. He said he wouldn&#8217;t let me think I could
be better than he was and he was going to live straight
the rest of his life. But Tommy would never have
quit. There would always have been some girl; and
he just had to have his parties. I suppose there&#8217;s no
use worrying about that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Grace consoled her, &#8220;things just have to be.
You can&#8217;t change anything. Ward and I said good-bye
to each other tonight. So that&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; Irene replied after a deliberate
inspection of Grace&#8217;s face. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t count much
on Ward giving you up. Love is a strange thing.
You&#8217;ll go on loving each other and breaking your
hearts about it and then some day you&#8217;ll meet and
things will begin all over again. I&#8217;ve always been
pretty cynical about these things, but I know love
when I see it. It&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Irene!&#8221; whispered Grace, a sob in her
throat. &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear it! To think of Tommy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her hand stole out and clasped Irene&#8217;s. The events<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
of the night had made upon both an impression that
never could be effaced. Aware of this, silence held
them until the lights of the station flashed upon the
windows.</p>

<p>Moore was on the platform, and they found a quiet
corner of the waiting room where Irene told the story
of the accident. John expressed no surprise, made
no criticism; merely said that he was proud that they
had thought of him. Trenton had suggested that they
ask Moore to visit the newspaper offices and then go
to Kemp&#8217;s house&mdash;Mrs. Kemp was still away&mdash;and
notify the servants. John&#8217;s practical mind had considered
every aspect of the matter after his brief talk
with Craig over the telephone and he had already dispatched
the coroner to the scene of the accident that
there might be no delay or subsequent criticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner you both get home the better,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll decide now that you were both with me
all evening. I&#8217;ll account for my knowledge of the
accident by explaining to the newspapers that Mr.
Kemp&#8217;s chauffeur called me on the telephone after
trying to get Judge Sanders, who&#8217;s Kemp&#8217;s lawyer
and an old friend. It happens that the judge left
for Washington tonight. I think that covers it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until Grace had crept into bed that she
was able to think clearly. It was like a hideous
dream that Kemp was dead&mdash;that she had seen him
die. His death obscured the memory of her parting
with Trenton, or blending with it, became a part
of the dissolution of all things. Alone in the dark,
remorse stole upon her like a nightmare. From the
hour that she had met Kemp and Trenton a doom
had followed her. In a few short months she had
played havoc with her life. She groped back to
her days at the University&mdash;happy days, they were;
days of clean wholesome living and buoyant aspiration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
And she never could be the same care-free girl
again.</p>

<p>It was not till near dawn that she slept, to be wakened
by her mother a little before the prompting of
the alarm clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something awful&#8217;s happened, Grace. Thomas
Kemp died last night, on the way home from his
farm. There was an accident to his car but the paper
says he died of heart disease. Mr. Trenton was with
him. Your father&#8217;s terribly upset; he doesn&#8217;t know
how it will affect his prospects. It&#8217;s a strange part
of it that only yesterday Kemp closed a deal for the
purchase of the Cummings Company. The paper
says he&#8217;d gone out to the farm with Mr. Trenton
to talk over the merger.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was necessary for Grace to hear Kemp&#8217;s death
discussed in all its bearings at the breakfast table.
The talk was chiefly between her mother and Ethel,
Durland merely confirming or correcting, when appealed
to, their statements as to items of the dead
man&#8217;s history. They speculated fruitlessly as to the
fate of Kemp&#8217;s business interests, and how much he
was worth and whether he had left large sums to
charity.</p>

<p>Grace read the account of the accident and the long
biographical sketch of Kemp while this was in progress.
Trenton and Moore had managed the thing
well. Trenton&#8217;s statement as to the manner of his
friend&#8217;s death bore every mark of veracity, and it was
fortified by the coroner&#8217;s report and a statement from
Kemp&#8217;s physician.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; remarked Ethel, &#8220;that Irene Kirby
will be terribly shocked. It&#8217;s a wonder she wasn&#8217;t
with him. They were always gadding about the country
together. I&#8217;m relieved, Grace, that you weren&#8217;t
mixed up in this mess.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so to your sister, Ethel,&#8221; admonished
Mrs. Durland. &#8220;There are things about Mr. Kemp
I never knew. It seems he gave large sums to some
of our needy institutions and wouldn&#8217;t let it be known.
And he was beautiful to all his employees. It&#8217;s not
for us to say he wasn&#8217;t a good man.&#8221;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Irene, the day after Kemp&#8217;s funeral,
&#8220;I hope Tommy knows all the fine things that have
been said about him. I cried when I read about the
poor people who went to his house just to look at him
again&mdash;people he&#8217;d helped in their troubles for years,
and you can be sure he always did it with a smile.
I met Ward as I was coming down this morning. He
was on his way to Judge Sanders&#8217;s office and didn&#8217;t
see me till I spoke to him. You&#8217;d think he&#8217;d lost
his own brother! He asked about you and said to
tell you not to worry about anything. And he smiled
in that wistful way he has. He said he might be
kept here some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not!&#8221; Grace cried, and her eyes filled
with tears.</p>

<p>She was already trying to accustom herself to the
idea that they were never to meet again and the
prospect of encountering him filled her with mingled
hope and dismay. A few days later when Kemp&#8217;s
will was published her heart bounded as she read that
the testator had appointed Trenton the managing
trustee of Kemp&#8217;s industrial enterprises, and that
he would in all likelihood become a resident of Indianapolis.
His picture was published, with a laudatory
account of his career. The purchase of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
Cummings concern, which was consummated on the
day of Kemp&#8217;s death, greatly increased the responsibilities
of the trustee, who was to serve for a period
of ten years.</p>

<p>It was with confused sensations of happy pride and
poignant heartache that Grace read all this. At home
it was necessary constantly to play a part, to feign
indifference as to Trenton&#8217;s suddenly attained prominence,
while her mother and Ethel reviewed daily all
the potentialities of the situation as it affected Stephen
Durland, who stolidly refrained from expressing any
opinion as to what bearing Kemp&#8217;s death might have
on his personal affairs.</p>

<p>The complexities of her life seemed to Grace enormously
multiplied. Trenton was there&mdash;in town&mdash;no
doubt walking at times the streets she traversed
going to and from her work, and she could not see
him&mdash;must never see him again! If only the family
affairs were less perplexing&mdash;Roy&#8217;s future, clouded by
his marriage, dominated all the domestic councils&mdash;she
could leave; go where the remembrance of
him would be less an hourly torture.</p>

<p>In combating her longing to see him she sought
comfort in the thought that his new duties would
help him to forget; and she wanted him to forget.
With his nature he was sure to be profoundly affected
by his friend&#8217;s death and the confidence Kemp had
reposed in him even from the grave. She found a certain
luxury of sorrow in these thoughts; she wanted
him to be happy, even if his happiness were to be won
only by forgetting her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Reynolds</span> called Grace on the telephone a
week after Kemp&#8217;s death and with her usual kindly
peremptoriness demanded that Grace dine with her
the following night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went away unexpectedly and didn&#8217;t have a chance
to let you know. I&#8217;ve got something I want to talk
to you about&mdash;just you and me. Please come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was ashamed not to manifest more cordiality
in accepting the invitation but she was beset by fears
lest Miss Reynolds was seizing the first possible moment
to question her as to her singular conduct at
the door on the afternoon when she had gone to the
house with Trenton. And that seemed long ago, hidden
by the black wall of an impenetrable past.</p>

<p>Miss Reynolds called for her at Shipley&#8217;s at the
closing hour and greeted her as though nothing had
happened. She had been summoned to Baltimore
on business, she explained. She talked in her brisk
fashion throughout the dinner,&mdash;of impersonal matters,
not mentioning the Trentons at all until they
were settled in the living room.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, I think I prefer plain bread-and-butter
people&mdash;plain folks. A woman traveling with a maid
and pretending to be keen about poor suffering humanity
seems to me a good deal of a joke. Mrs. Trenton
did one thing for me though and I ought to be
grateful for that,&mdash;she sent me scampering back to the
conservatives! I&#8217;d been just a little infected with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
of these new ideas, but after having that woman in
my house two days and hearing her talk and seeing
how fussy she is about her personal comfort, I&#8217;m for
hanging on to the old fogy notions a while longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Miss Reynolds continued her dissection of Mrs.
Trenton&#8217;s social program, Grace felt suddenly a strong
impulse to tell her friend the whole story of her acquaintance
with Trenton. In a way Miss Reynolds
had a right to know. She waited, wondering how she
could begin and what her friend would say, when
Miss Reynolds said in her characteristically abrupt
fashion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, little girl, you&#8217;ve got something on
your mind; you haven&#8217;t been listening to me at all!
You needn&#8217;t be afraid of me; I&#8217;m a queer old person
but sometimes I do understand. I wouldn&#8217;t force
your confidence; you know that,&mdash;but&mdash;why you dear
<i>child</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace&#8217;s eyes had filled with tears. Miss Reynolds
crossed to her quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How clumsy I am! I wouldn&#8217;t hurt you for
worlds, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down on a stool at Grace&#8217;s feet and drew
the girl&#8217;s hands into her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor dear heart,&#8221; she murmured softly. &#8220;It&#8217;s an
awful big old world and little girls do sometimes get
hurt&mdash;and lost. Maybe you&#8217;d like me to call the car
and take you for a drive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I want to tell you; I&#8217;ve got to tell you. But
I&#8217;m afraid if I do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t tell me anything that would make me
stop loving you,&#8221; Miss Reynolds replied gently....</p>

<p>Grace spared herself in nothing. She told the whole
story, told it as a child might confess a grievous fault
at a mother&#8217;s knee, described the spirit of revolt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
in which she had thought to ignore the old barriers,
scorned the safeguards that had offered protection,
exulted in her freedom. And now, appalled by the
consequences of her treason she found herself defenceless,
groping for the support of the very wall
that she had contemptuously disregarded. Her day
of rebellion was past; she was now eager to be received
again into the ancient citadel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said finally, &#8220;that that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then for the first time Miss Reynolds looked up
at her. Her eyes were wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little girl,&#8221; she began and then was silent
for a time, gently stroking the girl&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed there was something wrong, of course,&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;when I met you in the hall that day.
When I went in I saw right away that my interruption
was unfortunate. But Mrs. Trenton very calmly
introduced me to her husband. We talked a moment
and he left. As he went out he merely bowed to her
without saying anything. He struck me as being a
gentleman&mdash;none of the look of a dissolute person,
certainly a handsome man&mdash;a high-bred look and air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, tell me you saw the fineness, the nobility in
him! I couldn&#8217;t bear to have you hate him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, I don&#8217;t hate him. I&#8217;m only sorry for
both of you! But&mdash;I don&#8217;t think you quite understand&mdash;well,
that as individuals we are responsible to
those who have prior claims upon our consideration.
For the sake of happiness to the greater number we
must often give up our own happiness. Many beautiful
and noble women have done that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I love him! I love him so!&#8221; moaned the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe you do, dear. It&#8217;s pitiful&mdash;the
whole thing. Be sure I feel for you; I want to help
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>Miss Reynolds rose and took a turn across the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in his favor that he realized the thing couldn&#8217;t
go on; that for your sake it had to stop. That woman
might easily ruin your life; and of course she has
the right on her side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;yes, I know. I&#8217;ve no justification at all
except&mdash;except&mdash;I love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand. I believe you truly love
him; but now its my business as your friend to urge
you to forget. I realize that it won&#8217;t be easy. It
would simplify matters if you could go away,&mdash;see
other people, develop new interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;d thought of that,&#8221; Grace replied. &#8220;But
I can&#8217;t leave home; there are difficulties; it wouldn&#8217;t
be kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I understand that. But that brings me to the
matter I asked you here to talk about. I want to
equip a house which self-supporting young women
can manage entirely by themselves with the fewest
possible restrictions, not an institution&mdash;I hate the
word&mdash;but a club. You notice I&#8217;m not smoking!&#8221;
Miss Reynolds smiled. &#8220;Well, Mrs. Trenton cured
me of that; she left me bored with the whole business
of being an emancipated woman. I&#8217;ve got the idea
that the house I propose can set a standard of morals
and manners&mdash;something that will be good for the
whole community. But there mustn&#8217;t be a lot of restrictions.
I want the girls who live there to use it
as though it were their own home. I have every confidence
that they&#8217;ll make a happy household with just
a little sympathy and encouragement, and,&#8221; she
smiled, &#8220;I hope&mdash;my example!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly wonderful!&#8221; cried Grace. &#8220;And it&#8217;s
just like you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>&#8220;Humph! It&#8217;s perfectly selfish on my part; I expect
to have a lot of fun getting it started; maybe the
girls will let me dig in the garden now and then.
There&#8217;ll be a garden and tennis courts, and they must
have a dance once a week, and I might drop in occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll adore you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t mean to bother them. There are
such houses in New York and Chicago and I&#8217;m going
to visit them and get all the practical ideas I can
before I say anything about it. I need some one to
help me collect data and look after the thousand
and one details of planning. We&#8217;ll call it a secretaryship.
Now, Grace,&#8221; and Miss Reynolds beamed on
her, &#8220;will <i>you</i> help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Reynolds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be just what you need right now,&#8221; Miss
Reynolds went on, ignoring the girl&#8217;s questioning,
troubled look. &#8220;In fact, my dear child, you put the
whole idea in my head by things you&#8217;ve dropped from
time to time about the problems of young business
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now&mdash;since you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear child, it&#8217;s knowing that makes me all the
more eager to have your help! It&#8217;s only people who
make mistakes and suffer that really understand. And
we&#8217;ve got to have some heart in our club! So we&#8217;ll
call it settled and we&#8217;ll go to New York two weeks
from today and begin our work.&#8221;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Grace&#8217;s announcement at home that she was to
leave Shipley&#8217;s to become Miss Reynolds&#8217;s secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
greatly pleased her mother, who saw in the change
a social advancement. It was much more in keeping
with her idea of the Durland dignity for a daughter
of the house to serve a lady of wealth as secretary
than to be selling ready-made-clothing. And Mrs.
Durland hoped Grace would appreciate the privilege
of becoming identified with so praiseworthy a philanthropy.</p>

<p>Ethel, possibly jealous of Miss Reynolds&#8217;s growing
interest in Grace, expressed at once her concern as
to proper religious influences in the proposed club.
She confessed to disappointment that Miss Reynolds
had not manifested more interest in the girls&#8217; club
in Dr. Ridgely&#8217;s church. Miss Reynolds might very
easily have given the church the benefit of the money
she would spend on an independent work. It was not
quite loyal, she thought, to the church and all it stood
for; but she hoped the souls of the young women who
lived in the club would be properly cared for and that
Dr. Ridgely would be on the board; she favored strong
boards to administer such institutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be no board,&#8221; Grace answered
cheerily, &#8220;of the kind you mean. The girls are going
to run the place themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it won&#8217;t last long. I have no faith in such
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better get some, Sis. Miss Reynolds knows what
she&#8217;s about. She&#8217;s hoping others will follow her
example and make a chain of such clubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace learned from her father that there had been
no developments in the motor since Kemp&#8217;s death;
he didn&#8217;t know where he stood, but Trenton had been
encouraging as to the outcome. The reorganization
made necessary by the absorption of the Cummings
concern was causing the delay, Durland thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>&#8220;Trenton&#8217;s a busy man these days, but he&#8217;s spent
several evenings with me at the shop. He&#8217;s a big
man; he knows what he&#8217;s about and he&#8217;s been mighty
fine to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that, daddy. I&#8217;m sure Mr. Trenton
would tell you if he didn&#8217;t mean to go through with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re right, Grace. It&#8217;s a little hard
waiting&mdash;and I&#8217;ve done a lot of waiting in my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear! We&#8217;ve got to believe the patient waiter
gets the biggest tips&mdash;that&#8217;s our slogan!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tapped him lightly on the shoulder as she
spoke, keeping time to her words. He didn&#8217;t know
how his praise of Trenton had warmed her heart.
The fact that he saw Trenton and no doubt would
continue to meet him frequently gave her father a
new interest in her eyes.</p>

<p>Grace saw Miss Reynolds every few days, and was
finding relief and happiness in the prospect of her
new work. Irene expressed the greatest satisfaction
when Grace told her that she was leaving Shipley&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more in your line, Grace. And I certainly
hand it to Little Old Ready-Money for having the
sense to appreciate you. If she hadn&#8217;t been the real
goods she&#8217;d have backed away when you told her about
Ward. Some woman, I say! It does sort of cheer
things up to know there are people like that in the
world. By the way, have you seen John lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not since Tommy died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s another of the saints!&#8221; said Irene.
&#8220;He&#8217;s pretending now he doesn&#8217;t know we were on
a wild party and that he saved our reputations. He
won&#8217;t talk about it; not at all! So don&#8217;t try to thank
him. Tommy&#8217;s estate is going through Sanders&#8217;s office
and John&#8217;s no end busy. He&#8217;s getting acquainted
with Ward&mdash;funny how things work out! But if John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
has any idea about you and Ward he never lets on. I
thought you might like to know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s probably done some thinking,&#8221; Grace
replied soberly; &#8220;John isn&#8217;t stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my idea of a prince, if you ask me! He&#8217;s
making a big hit with my family; mother thinks he&#8217;s
the grandest young man who ever came up the pike.
She&#8217;s got him carrying all his mending and darning
out to her to do and he&#8217;s so nice to her I&#8217;m getting
jealous!&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Roy came home for a week-end, but only after his
mother had written him repeatedly urging a visit. He
had really been at work&mdash;Mrs. Durland had this from
the Dean of the Law School&mdash;but his enthusiasm for
the profession his mother had chosen for him was still
at low ebb. He wanted to find work on a newspaper;
he wanted to go West; anything was preferable to
setting up as a lawyer in an office of his own. It was
disclosed that Mrs. Durland had arranged to mortgage
the house to raise money with which to establish
him. But it was the definite announcement of her
purpose to bring Roy&#8217;s wife home immediately after
commencement, that the young couple might, as Mrs.
Durland put it, begin their life together, that precipitated
a crisis in Ethel&#8217;s relations with her family.</p>

<p>The baby would be born in August and Mrs. Durland
contended that the family dignity would suffer
far less if Roy announced his marriage when he left
the university and joined his wife in his father&#8217;s house
at Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Ethel was outraged by the plan. She would not
live under the same roof with that creature; and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
availed herself of the opportunity to tell Roy what
she thought of him. He had always been petted and
indulged; his mother had favored him over the other
children; they had all been obliged to practice the
most rigid self-denial to educate him, and this was
the result!</p>

<p>Roy surlily martyrized himself in meeting his sister&#8217;s
attack. He had never wanted to go to college;
he hated the law and if it hadn&#8217;t been for John Moore&#8217;s
stupid meddling he would have extricated himself
from the scrape with the girl he had been forced to
marry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought you&#8217;d really do it, mother,&#8221; Ethel
moaned. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be cruel enough to
visit this shame on me. Everybody will talk; we&#8217;ll
be ostracized by all our friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace&#8217;s attempt to restore harmony only infuriated
Ethel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told Osgood the whole story,&#8221; Ethel announced.
&#8220;I felt that was the only honorable thing to
do and he&#8217;s been splendid about it. We&#8217;ve been engaged
since Easter and he&#8217;s ready to marry me at any
time. I&#8217;d hoped we&#8217;d be able to live at home for a
little while, but now I&#8217;m going! I can already feel
that abandoned creature in the house! Osgood has a
good offer in Cincinnati and I&#8217;ll marry him tomorrow
and go away and never come back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would if I were you,&#8221; said Grace, as Ethel
stalked from the room. &#8220;Safety first! Grab all the
life belts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ethel paused and pointed an accusing finger at
Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;You! You&#8217;re a pretty one to talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen Durland raised his head, coughed and returned
to his reading. Roy announced that he was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
down town. The front door slammed upon him
and Mrs. Durland burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think&mdash;you don&#8217;t think Ethel <i>means</i>
she&#8217;s going!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly hope she means it,&#8221; Grace replied wearily.
&#8220;Osgood&#8217;s not a bad fellow and maybe he can beat
some sense into her.&#8221;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Grace had never been in New York before and Miss
Reynolds gave her every opportunity to see the sights.
The investigation of devices for housing business
women Miss Reynolds pursued with her usual thoroughness,
broadening her inquiry to include a survey of
the general social effort in the metropolis. She accepted
no invitations in which Grace could not be included,
with the result that they dined or had luncheon in half
a dozen private homes, and were entertained in fashionable
restaurants and at the Colony Club.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so good to me!&#8221; said Grace one night when
they reached their hotel after a dinner at the house
of some old friends of Miss Reynolds. &#8220;All the
guests were somebody except me! I wonder what
they&#8217;d think if they knew that only a little while ago
I was Number Eighteen in Shipley&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They knew you were good to look at,&#8221; Miss Reynolds
replied, &#8220;and talked well and had very pretty
manners. Nothing else was any of their business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But sometimes&mdash;sometimes, Cousin Beulah, when
your friends are so kind and treat me so beautifully,
I can&#8217;t help thinking that if they knew about me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Grace, this busy world&#8217;s a lot kinder
than it gets credit for being! Even if the world knew
it wouldn&#8217;t condemn you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>They had visited a settlement house on the East
Side one morning and were driving to Washington
Square for luncheon with a friend of Miss Reynolds
who lived in one of the old houses which she said
Grace ought to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a bit early for our engagement,&#8221; Miss Reynolds
remarked as they reached Broadway. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got half an hour to look at Trinity.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked quickly through the yard, that Grace
might experience the thrill of reading the historic
names on the grave-stones, and entered the church.
It was the noon hour and sightseers mingling with the
employees from the towering buildings came and went.
Miss Reynolds and Grace sat down in a pew near
the door. A service was in progress and Grace, unfamiliar
with liturgic churches, at once fixed her attention
on the chancel. The minister&#8217;s voice reciting
the office, the sense of age communicated by the
walls of the edifice, all had their effect on her. She
felt singularly alone. The heartache that had troubled
her little since she left home again became acute.
Here was peace, but it was a peace that mocked rather
than calmed the spirit....</p>

<p>... &#8220;We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and
conditions of men.&#8221;...</p>

<p>The mournful cadence of the prayer only increased
her loneliness. She was like a child who, watching night
descend in a strange place, is overcome by a stifling
nostalgia. Her throat ached with inexpressible emotions;
her heart fluttered like a wild bird in her breast.
She knew she wanted Trenton; nothing else mattered;
no one else could ever fill his place. She bowed her
head and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>A man walked hesitatingly down the aisle and slipped
into a pew in front of her. Apparently he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
one of the many who were seeking relief from the
world&#8217;s turmoil. She remained motionless, staring.
It was unbelievable that it could be Trenton; and yet
beyond question it was he. His coming was like an
answer to prayer. She recalled what he had written
after his illness, that he had thought of her once so
intently that he had brought her into the room....</p>

<p>She remembered that he had once told her that
his New York office was near Trinity. Perhaps it
was his habit to drop in as he passed.</p>

<p>Miss Reynolds, turning the pages of a prayer book,
evidently had not noticed, or had failed to recognize
him. Presently she glanced at her watch, touched
Grace&#8217;s arm and nodded that it was time to go. As
they paused in the entry to look at the bronze doors
Grace decided not to tell her friend that Trenton was
in the church; but suddenly he stood beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is surely more than a coincidence,&#8221; he said,
smiling gravely as he shook hands. &#8220;I pass here every
day but I hadn&#8217;t been in before for years. But today&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked together to the gate, Grace silent,
Miss Reynolds and Trenton discussing the weather
to cover their embarrassment. Grace, still awed by
his appearance, saw that he looked careworn; even
when he smiled at some remark of Miss Reynolds his
eyes scarcely brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a taxi here somewhere.&#8221; Miss Reynolds
was glancing about uncertainly when the machine
drew in at the curb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you staying in town long?&#8221; asked Trenton as
he opened the cab door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few days,&#8221; Miss Reynolds replied guardedly.
&#8220;Grace and I are here on a little business. I
wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>Without finishing the sentence she stepped into the
car and gave the Washington Square address. Trenton
rousing as he realized that they were about to leave
him, bent forward and took Grace&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so good to see you!&#8221; he said steadily. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going West tonight. Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s been very ill;
she&#8217;s in a sanitarium in Connecticut.&#8221; Then, aware
that he couldn&#8217;t detain them longer, &#8220;Miss Reynolds,
I&#8217;m sure you and Miss Durland will take good care of
each other!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Grace faintly and watched him
disappear in the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to ask him to come and dine with us,&#8221;
said Miss Reynolds when the car was in motion, &#8220;but
I changed my mind. And now I wish I could change
it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Grace answered colorlessly.
&#8220;It would have been a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps.&#8221; And Trenton was not referred to
again.</p>

<p>But all the rest of the day Grace lived upon the
memory of his look, his voice. He was still in a world
she knew; any turn of the long road might bring him
in sight again.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>A week in Chicago followed a fortnight in New
York and Grace had filled a large portfolio with notes
and pamphlets bearing upon Miss Reynolds&#8217;s projected
house for business girls. Her mother&#8217;s letters
had kept her informed of family affairs and she was
prepared to find Ethel gone and Roy&#8217;s wife established
in the house. Ethel had refused to be married
at home and the ceremony had been performed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
Dr. Ridgely in his study, with only Mrs. Durland
present to represent the family. Ethel and Haley had
left at once for Cincinnati, where they were to make
their home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did the best I could about it, Grace,&#8221; Mrs.
Durland kept repeating pathetically. &#8220;I hated to
have her go that way, but she would do it. She said
some pretty unkind things to your father after you
left, and he didn&#8217;t go to see her married.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Sadie, the new member of the family, Grace
formed an immediate liking. The girl was so anxious
to be friendly and to do her share of the domestic
labor and so appreciative of kindness that she brought
a new element of cheer into the household. She was
intelligent, and amusing, after a slangy fashion; even
Stephen Durland laughed at her jokes.</p>

<p>Grace found that her position as secretary to Miss
Reynolds was far from being a sinecure. She was
present at all the conferences with the architect who
had now been engaged, and when the announcement
of the new club for business girls could no longer
be deferred it fell to Grace&#8217;s lot to answer the letters
that poured in upon Miss Reynolds. A bedroom was
fitted up as an office and there Grace spent half of
every day, keeping accounts, typing letters and answering
the importunities of the telephone.</p>

<p>One day in June Grace went to Judge Sanders&#8217;
office on an errand for Miss Reynolds. It was merely
a matter of leaving an abstract of title for examination,
but as she was explaining what was wanted to
the office girl John Moore came out of one of the
inner rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caught in the act!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been
hankering to see you. Can&#8217;t you give me a few minutes,
right now?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>She was really in a hurry, but when he earnestly
protested that he had business with her she followed
him into a room whose door bore the inscription: &#8220;Mr.
Moore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks terribly important, John,&#8221; she said
indicating the lettering. &#8220;Onward and upward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, when they were seated. &#8220;Mr.
Kemp&#8217;s death has thrown a lot of business into the
office and some of it that doesn&#8217;t require much brain
power they leave to me. Mr. Trenton just left a
few minutes ago. He came in to see if I&#8217;d go down
into Knox County to inventory a coal mine Kemp
owned. I&#8217;m getting a lot of little jobs like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, as he wanted her to, at his boyish pride
in his work. She derived a deep pleasure from the
thought that Trenton had just been there. Trenton
would appreciate John&#8217;s qualities; they would appreciate
each other&#8217;s qualities and talents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t know,&#8221; John went on, &#8220;and
maybe I oughtn&#8217;t to tell you; but right here on my
desk are the papers for your father to sign away
his rights in his motor patents and his formula for
that non-breakable spark-plug porcelain you probably
know about. Your father&#8217;s coming in tomorrow
to sign up. Mr. Trenton has left a check here for
advance royalties that will pay the Durland grocery
bill for sometime to come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean it, John! I&#8217;d been afraid Mr.
Kemp&#8217;s death would end all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trenton&#8217;s the whole cheese in that business now
and he knows what he&#8217;s doing. He says those two
things are bound to earn your father a lot of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father certainly deserves any success that may
come to him. I&#8217;m so glad for him and mother&mdash;just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
now when things at home don&#8217;t look particularly
bright.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of Roy? Well, Roy will get his
law degree but that boy had no more business in the
law than I&#8217;d have in a millinery shop. I sneaked him
up here last Sunday and had Mr. Trenton take a
look at him. You know Roy&#8217;s a smart, likable chap,
with a friendly way of meeting people and I thought
maybe there was a job somewhere in the Kemp organization
that he&#8217;d fit into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&#8221; began Grace, doubtfully, remembering
Roy&#8217;s anger at John&#8217;s meddling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Roy took it fine! Mr. Trenton&#8217;s taken a
fancy to him; in fact they liked each other immensely.
Roy&#8217;s to get his sheepskin and then go right into
the Kemp factory for six months to get an idea of
the business and then transfer to the sales department.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, John, that&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed Grace.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t <i>know</i> how relieved I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not half as relieved as Roy is to dodge the
law,&#8221; John chuckled. &#8220;That boy will make good.
I&#8217;d told Mr. Trenton all about him and he was as
kind to him as a father. Roy wanted me to ask you to
spring the news on his mother. She&#8217;s so keen about
having him a lawyer that he&#8217;s afraid to tell her himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, John; I&#8217;ll do it tonight. And thank you!
Oh, thank you for everything!&#8221;</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Stephen Durland&#8217;s announcement that the Kemp
Company had taken up the option on his motor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
made a contract for the manufacture of the porcelain
tempered in some degree his wife&#8217;s disappointment
when Grace broke the news that Roy had renounced
the law. Mrs. Durland took comfort in the fact that
Roy had really passed the law examinations and was
admitted to practice with the rest of his class. This
measurably satisfied her family pride by enrolling
Roy on the list of attorneys of his state in succession
to his grandfather and great-grandfather. Roy, however,
was much less thrilled by this than by the prospect
of having at once employment that he felt was
within his powers. The idea of making machinery had
never interested him, but the idea of selling it appealed
to him strongly and for the first time in his life he
found himself in sympathy and accord with his father.</p>

<p>Stephen Durland had money in the bank and was
reasonably sure of a good income for the remainder
of his life. The Kemp publicity department had given
wide advertisement to his discoveries, and several technical
journals had asked for photographs of the inventor,
the taking of which Grace joyfully supervised.
A kind fate having intervened to prevent the
mortgaging of the old home Mrs. Durland was now
considering selling it and satisfying the great desire
of her heart by moving beyond the creek.</p>

<p>Ethel, hearing of the family&#8217;s unexpected prosperity,
had been up for a visit, and returned to
Cincinnati with a supply of linens for her apartment.
Her mother thought it only fair that she should participate
in the good luck that had at last overtaken
the Durlands and Grace agreed with her. Haley&#8217;s
earnings were meager and Ethel received the gift graciously.
She even volunteered a few generous words
to her young sister-in-law, about whom she admitted
she might have been mistaken.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>Durland declined to become interested in the proposed
change of residence. In fact he continued to
appear dazed by his good fortune and Grace, for years
familiar with his moods, was mystified by his conduct.</p>

<p>One evening when they were alone on the front
porch she asked a question about affairs at the factory,
really in the hope that he would speak of Trenton.
When he had answered perfunctorily that everything
was running smoothly and that they would be
ready to put the new motor on the market in six
months he remarked that Trenton was away a good
deal.</p>

<p>&#8220;His wife&#8217;s sick, you know; down East somewhere.
I guess he&#8217;s had a good deal to worry him. When
he&#8217;s in town he works hard. There&#8217;s a lot to do
moving the stuff from Cummings&#8217;s old plant, and
putting up the new buildings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Trenton&#8217;s certainly been a good friend to
you, daddy. But of course he wouldn&#8217;t have taken
your patents if they hadn&#8217;t been all they promised to
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland turned his head to make sure they were
not overheard. Mrs. Durland was somewhere in the
house and Roy and Sadie had gone for a walk. Durland
cleared his throat and said in a low tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never have got those things right, Grace. Trenton
straightened me out on a lot o&#8217; points that were
too much for me. He worked with me every night for
a week till everything came right. He oughtn&#8217;t to give
me the credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, daddy, that&#8217;s just like you! Of course,
they&#8217;re all your ideas! But it was fine of Mr. Trenton
to help you round them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was more than that, Grace,&#8221; Durland persisted
stubbornly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>This, then, was the cause of her father&#8217;s preoccupation
and the embarrassment with which he had been
hearing himself praised. It was Trenton&#8217;s genius,
not his, that had perfected the motor! Something
sweet and wistful like the scents of the summer night
crept into her heart. She was happy, supremely
happy, in the thought that Trenton had done this,
given her father the benefit of his skill, and for her.
Yes; it was all for her, and for those close and dear
to her. But her father&#8217;s confession moved her
greatly. The light from the window fell upon his hand,
which seemed to her to symbolize failure as it hung
inert from the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, lots of inventors must accept help from experts,
when they&#8217;ve got as far as they can by themselves.
Don&#8217;t you worry about that! I&#8217;m sure it
was a pleasure to Mr. Trenton to help you over your
difficulties. He naturally wouldn&#8217;t want any of the
credit when you did all the real work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Durland shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done it!&#8221; he said huskily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
understand even now how he got the results he did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; she exclaimed with a happy little
laugh. &#8220;No man would be so generous of his talents
as all that; men are not built that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she knew that it was true, and that it was because
Trenton loved her that he had saved her father
from another and crushing failure.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>She was able to keep track of Trenton&#8217;s movements
through Irene, who got her information from John.
Grace and Trenton were holding strictly to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
agreement not to see each other. Once, as she waited
for the traffic to break at Washington and Meridian
Streets, Trenton passed in a car. Craig was driving
and Trenton, absorbed in a sheaf of papers, didn&#8217;t
lift his head. He was so near for a fleeting second
that she could have touched him. This, then, was to
be the way of it, their paths steadily diverging; or
if they met it would be as strangers who had ceased
to have any message for each other.</p>

<p>Sadie&#8217;s baby was born in August and Roy manifested
an unexpected degree of paternal pride in his
offspring. The summer wore on to September. Now
and then as she surveyed herself in the mirror it
seemed to Grace that she was growing old and that
behind her lay a long life-time, crowded with experience.
She felt herself losing touch with the world.
Miss Reynolds, with all her kindness, was exacting.
Grace saw no young people and her amusements were
few. Irene, who watched her with a keenly critical
eye, remarked frequently upon her good looks, declaring
that she was growing handsomer all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t really reach perfection till you&#8217;re forty,&#8221;
said Irene, &#8220;and have some gray in your raven tresses.
I&#8217;ll look like a fat yellow cucumber when I&#8217;m forty!&#8221;</p>

<p>Unless all signs failed Irene and John were deeply in
love with each other&mdash;the old story of the attraction of
apparently irreconcilable natures.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told John everything&mdash;all about Tommy, of
course, to give him a chance to escape,&#8221; Irene confided.
&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t jar him a bit. That man&#8217;s faith
would make a good woman of Jezabel. John&#8217;s already
got some little jobs&mdash;secretaryships of corporations
that Judge Sanders threw his way. He thinks we can
be married early next year and I&#8217;m studying real
estate ads. I&#8217;ve got enough money to make a payment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
on a bungalow as far from Shipley&#8217;s as a nickel
will carry me and there&#8217;ll be a cow and a few choice
hens. Back to nature for me, dearie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just marvelous!&#8221; cried Grace. &#8220;You and
John are bound to reach the high places. You&#8217;ve
got just the qualities John needs to help him get on.
When he goes into politics after while you&#8217;ll be a big
asset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I might like a few years in Washington,&#8221;
Irene replied meditatively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already joined up
with a woman&#8217;s political club to learn how to fool &#8217;em
all the time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Grace&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Irene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love John.&#8221; Irene&#8217;s eyes filled with tears. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
talked so much foolish nonsense to you about men, and
you must have thought me hard and sordid. I wouldn&#8217;t
want you to think I married John just to escape from
myself. He&#8217;s the grandest man in the world, and I&#8217;d
die before I&#8217;d injure him, or cause him a second&#8217;s
heartache. You do believe that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and it&#8217;s dear and beautiful. I&#8217;m so glad for
both of you! I hope&mdash;I know, you will be happy!&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days later Grace met John in the street and
he turned and walked with her a little way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Irene&#8217;s told you? Well, I want to tell you,
too!&#8221; he said with his broadest smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t need to be told, John! I saw it
coming. And I congratulate you both with all my
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I knew you&#8217;d be glad, Grace,&#8221; he said; then
his face grew grave. &#8220;You see Irene was troubled
a lot&mdash;well about little mistakes she&#8217;d made. She was
mighty fine about that. When I found I loved her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
and she loved me, nothing else made any difference.
And she&#8217;s so strong and fine and splendid you just
know it was never in her <i>heart</i> to do wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, John,&#8221; Grace replied, touched by his simple
earnestness, his fine tolerance, his anxiety that she
should know that Irene had withheld nothing of her
past that could ever cast a shadow upon their happiness.</p>

<p>Late in September Miss Reynolds proposed to
Grace that they go to Colorado to look at the mountains.
The architect could be relied on to watch the
construction of the club house and Miss Reynolds insisted
that Grace had earned a vacation.</p>

<p>They established themselves in a hotel that commanded
a view of a great valley with snowy summits
beyond and Grace tramped and rode and won a measurable
serenity of spirit. Miss Reynolds may have
thought that amid new scenes the girl would forget
Trenton, but the look that came into Grace&#8217;s eyes
at times discouraged the hope. Then one evening, as
they sat in the hotel office reading their mail Miss
Reynolds laid a Denver newspaper on Grace&#8217;s knee
and quietly pointed to a headline: &#8220;Death of Mary
Graham Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>The end had come suddenly in the sanitarium
where Mrs. Trenton had been under treatment. Her
husband, the dispatch stated, was with her when
she died.</p>

<p>&#8220;She seemed ill when she was at my house,&#8221; remarked
Miss Reynolds; &#8220;she was frightfully nervous
and seemed to be constantly forcing herself. That
tired look in her eyes gave the impression of dissipation.
I&#8217;m ashamed to say it but I really thought she
might be addicted to drugs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Grace murmured, numbed, bewildered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
by the news. She had never taken the reports of
Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s illness seriously, believing Ward&#8217;s wife
was feigning illness to arouse her husband&#8217;s pity&mdash;perhaps
in the hope of reawakening his love. It had never
occurred to her that she might die.</p>

<p>As soon as possible Grace excused herself and went
to her room, where she flung herself on the bed and
lay for a long time in the dark, pondering. In spite
of their agreement not to write she had hoped constantly
to hear from him; and his silence she had interpreted
as meaning that he had found it easy to
forget. She now attributed his silence to the remorse
that had probably assailed him when he found that
Mrs. Trenton was hopelessly ill.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Grace had been home a week when she received a
letter from Trenton, written in Pittsburgh. He was
closing up his home; looking after the settlement of
Mrs. Trenton&#8217;s estate. She had bequeathed her considerable
property to the societies for social reform
in which she had been interested. He hoped to be
in Indianapolis shortly, he wrote, and continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... &#8220;My thoughts in these past weeks have
not been happy ones; but I must turn now to the
future. In my dark hours I have groped toward you,
felt the need of your leading hand. I love you. That
is the one great fact in the world. Whatever I have
left to me of life is yours; and it is now my right to
give it.... It was my fate, not my fault, that
I learned to love you. Nothing can change that. Let
me begin over again and prove my love for you&mdash;win<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
you as it is a woman&#8217;s right to be won, in the
world&#8217;s eyes. I want you to bear my name; belong
to me truly, help me to find and keep the path of
happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not understand herself as the days passed
and she felt no impulse to reply. She loved him still&mdash;there
was no question of that&mdash;but she tortured
herself with the idea that he had written only from
a chivalrous sense of obligation. Trenton was free;
but she too was free; and marriage was an uncertain
quantity. She encouraged in herself the belief that to
marry him would be only to invite unhappiness. While
she was still debating with herself, she learned from
Irene that Trenton was again in town and working
hard.</p>

<p>The new club for business girls, which Miss Reynolds
decided to name Friendship House, was in process
of furnishing and was to be opened on Thanksgiving
Day.</p>

<p>Nothing in the preparations had proved so embarrassing
as the choice of the first occupants. It might
have seemed that all the young women in town were
clamoring for admission and only fifty could be accommodated.
Miss Reynolds and Grace spent many
hours interviewing applicants. Then, too, there was
the matter of working out a plan for the general
management of Friendship House until the club members
took hold of it for themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girls can make their own rules,&#8221; said Miss
Reynolds. &#8220;But I&#8217;m going to have one little rule
printed and put in every room and worked into all
the doormats and stamped into the linen&mdash;just two
words&mdash;Be Kind! If we&#8217;d all live up to that this
would be a lot more comfortable world to live in!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>Being so constantly at Miss Reynolds&#8217;s Grace had
heard the Bob Cummingses mentioned frequently. The
merger had obliterated the name from the industrial
life of the city; the senior Cummings had gone West
to live with his eldest son and Miss Reynolds had
spoken frequently of the plight in which the collapse
of the family fortunes had left Bob. Evelyn came
in one morning when Grace was alone in the improvised
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve sold our house,&#8221; she announced, after they
had talked awhile. &#8220;It was mine, you know; a wedding
present from my uncle. And I&#8217;ve got about a
thousand a year. So I&#8217;m going to turn Bob loose
at his music. He&#8217;s already got a job as organist
in Dr. Ridgley&#8217;s church and he&#8217;s going to teach and
do some lecturing on music. He can do that wonderfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s perfectly splendid!&#8221; said Grace warmly.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s too bad&mdash;the business troubles. I&#8217;ve wanted
to tell you how sorry I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not so sure any one ought to be sorry
for us. Our difficulties have brought Bob and me
closer together, and our chances of happiness are
brighter than on our wedding day; really they are!
I&#8217;m saying this to you because you know Bob so well,
and I think you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace was not sure that she did understand and
when Evelyn left she meditated for a long time upon
the year&#8217;s changes. She had so jauntily gone out to
meet the world, risking her happiness in her confidence
that she was capable of directing her own destiny;
but life was not so easy! Life was an inexorable
schoolmaster who set very hard problems indeed!</p>

<p>Irene, pretending to be jealous of Miss Reynolds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
declared that there was no reason why Grace, in
becoming a philanthropist should forget her old
friends. This was on an afternoon when Grace, in
Shipley&#8217;s to pick up some odds and ends for Friendship
House, looked into the ready-to-wear floor for
a word with Irene.</p>

<p>Hard-pressed to defend her neglect she accepted
an invitation to accompany Irene and John to a movie
that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;John will have to work for an hour or so but we
can get in for the second show. You just come up
to Judge Sanders&#8217; office about eight and we can have
an old-fashioned heart-to-heart talk till John&#8217;s ready.
You never take me into your confidence any more,&#8221;
she concluded with an injured air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any confidences; but if I had you
certainly wouldn&#8217;t escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not seeing, Ward, I suppose?&#8221; Irene asked
carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Grace replied with badly-feigned indifference.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him and I have no intention
of seeing him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s all over,&#8221; said Irene stifling a yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s all over,&#8221; Grace replied testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange but Ward just can&#8217;t get that idea! Of
course he&#8217;s had a lot to do and think about but he&#8217;d
never force himself on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he wouldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Grace assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ward&#8217;s a free man,&#8221; said Irene dreamily. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
probably marry again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene! It was silly of me to be as crazy about
him as I was. That freedom I used to talk about
was all rubbish. We can&#8217;t do as we please in this
world,&mdash;you and I both learned that! And after&mdash;well&mdash;after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
all that happened I could never marry
Ward. And it would be a mistake for him to marry
me&mdash;a girl&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace Durland!&#8221; Irene interrupted with lofty
scorn, &#8220;you are talking like an idiot! You&#8217;re insulting
yourself and you&#8217;re insulting Ward. I know a
few things. He telephoned you at Miss Reynolds&#8217;s
twice and asked to see you and you refused. Don&#8217;t
let Miss Beulah Reynolds intimidate you! She took
you to Colorado hoping you&#8217;d forget Ward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Reynolds is perfectly fine!&#8221; Grace flared.
&#8220;She&#8217;s never said a word against Ward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she wouldn&#8217;t need to say it! She&#8217;s just trying
to keep you away from him. I&#8217;m not knocking Beulah&mdash;she&#8217;s
all right; but when there&#8217;s a man in the
world who is eating his heart out about you, you just
can&#8217;t stick your nose in the air and pretend you don&#8217;t
know he&#8217;s alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace had been proud of her strength in denying
Trenton the interview for which he had asked; but
she left Irene with an unquiet heart. Trenton was
lonely, and his letter had been written in a fine and
tender spirit. She knew that she was guilty
of dishonesty in trying to persuade herself that the
nature of their past association made marriage with
him impossible. He had said nothing that even remotely
suggested this. On the other hand he had
declared plainly that sooner or later he would have
her, meaning, of course, through marriage. She despised
herself for her inconsistencies. She had told
him that she loved him; love alone could have justified
their relationship; and yet she was viewing him
in the harshest light without giving him the hearing
for which he had asked at the earliest moment possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span></p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>She looked forward eagerly to the promised talk
with Irene and after supper she hurried down town
and was shot upward in the tall office building. She
found Irene and John sitting opposite each other at
a large flat top desk. Irene was helping John to
compare descriptions of property but she would be
free in a moment. He showed Grace into the big
library and laughingly gave her a law magazine to
read, saying it was the lightest literature the place
afforded.</p>

<p>The dingy volumes on the shelves impressed her
with a sense of the continuity of law through all the
ages. She glanced idly at the titles, Torts, Contracts,
Wills, Injunctions,&mdash;there must, in this world, be order,
rule and law! Life, nobly considered, was impossible
without law. It was the height of folly that
she had ever fancied herself a rebel, confident of her
right to do as she pleased. She had made her mistakes;
henceforth she meant to walk circumspectly
in the eyes of all men. She envied Irene her happiness
with John; as for herself, love had brought her nothing
but sorrow and heartache.</p>

<p>Her speculations were interrupted by the rustle
of papers in the adjoining room. The door was half
ajar and glancing in she saw a man seated at a desk,
busily scanning formidable looking documents and
affixing his signature.</p>

<p>Absorbed in his work he was evidently unaware
that he was observed. Her heart beat wildly as she
watched him. She stifled a desire to call to him;
checked an impulse to run to him. Irene had played
a trick upon her in thus bringing her so near to
Trenton! She wondered whether he had seen her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
was purposely ignoring her. Or, he might think she
had suggested this to Irene. Her face burned; she
would escape somehow. As she watched him he lifted
his head with a sigh, threw himself back wearily in his
chair and stared at the wall. No; she would not
speak to him; never again would she speak to him.
Panic-stricken she turned and began cautiously tiptoeing
toward the hall door with no thought but to
leave the place at once.</p>

<p>But, the door gained, her heart beat suffocatingly;
she could not go; she did love him, and to run away&mdash;</p>

<p>She stole into the room without disturbing his
reverie, and laid her hand lightly on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t go&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t leave you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she was on her knees beside him, looking up
into his startled eyes.</p>

<p>He raised her to her feet, tenderly, reverently, gazing
eagerly into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; he cried, his eyes alight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know; it just happened. I&mdash;I saw you&mdash;and
I just couldn&#8217;t run away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say that again! I&#8217;ve missed you so! You
can&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ve missed and needed you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;do you love me,&#8221; she asked softly, &#8220;as
you used to think you did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, more&mdash;more than all the world!&#8221;</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
